The thing is I don't know where to go from here. I was wondering if y'all could help.\n\nI would like something slice-of-life, and probably dubbed (but subbed is alright too). I have Netflix and Hulu (and a few others, just not crunchyroll)\n\nThe one I just finished was The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity, so something similar to that'd be great!\n\nTYSM!!!",

They feel so much more real and deeper than most other characters. \n\nI think too many people have very shallow viewes of these characters, which brings them undeserved hate. I love how there is always more to them than our first impression. They always lean either towards morally good or morally bad, but they are never only one of those. I live the complexity, the dilemmas and the beatiful stories you can get from them. The psychological aspect is so i teresting when you get deeper into the character",

These are the details I remember clearly:\n\nThe main characters were two brothers, I think twins, named Brune and Bruce.\n\nThey both had reddish hair and special powers.\n\nThere was a villain (or maybe a witch, I don't remember exactly) who was always chasing them.\n\nEach brother dated a different girl (they didn't share the same girl).\n\nWhen they were with these girls, the girls somehow absorbed the brothers' powers.\n\nThen, those same girls defended them and helped them fight the villain/witch using those absorbed powers.\nIt's an old anime, broadcast dubbed in Spanish (possibly from the 80s, 90s, or early 2000s).\n\n\n\nI've tried searching for it by name and synopsis, but nothing comes up, so maybe the names are from the dub in my country.\n\n\nIf anyone remembers this anime or something similar, any clue would be a huge help.

    "text": "Scarlet (2025) Review - LIGHT SPOILER So I watched Scarlet here in \\[REDACTED\\] and I must say.... it's a good animated film.\n\nIt made me cry like 6-7 times throughout the film but I'm a bit emotional person with certain aspects of the film.\n\nI'm not gonna' say the full details of the film like from start to finish, only the general.  \n  \n**1. The animation?**  \nI liked it even it's 3D/CGI (but there are parts where it will be 2D animated on certain scenes).  \nI also like the action and the close quarter fights of Scarlet.\n\n**2. The characters?**  \nI liked them, especially Scarlet and her counterpart in the film, Hijiri. Hijiri acts as a contrast to Scarlet, being what Scarlet would describe as a \"**good doer**.\"   \n  \nThroughout the film, Scarlet changes because of him.\n\n**3. The music?**  \nIt was good/alright, I don't really have anything to say as I'm not really good at explaining regarding with this aspect.\n\n**4. The plot?**  \nIt was alright.   \nScarlet's journey is a quest of revenge but overtime she questions the nature of it. At some point she says these things along the lines of...  \n  \n***\"What was the point of my life?\"***  \n***\"Why did he say that despite of how despicable that person who did this to us?\"***  \n***\"After I completed my revenge, I want to disappear\"***\n\nAt the end of the film, she have 2 choices:  \n**Forgive or Revenge.**\n\nShe struggles with this, although forgiveness may not be ***in the way one would think***.\n\nSome parts maybe cliche but i don't really mind them.\n\n**Overall, it's a 8/10 film. I would recommend it just the right amount.**\n\nThis is like at the end of Scarlet:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uotuuw1xiq6g1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7c607e612cac74a61e9d326c7c75183ce345572\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr29xc3xiq6g1.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d517d74a2f93ebe0dacbbd99a614fb72fda7343",

    "text": "World Trigger, Where Have You Been? I just wanted to share my point of view on an anime I recently discovered, because honestly, it caught me completely off guard.\n\nFor a long time, I’ve been searching for an anime that really clicks with me again, especially something with a very masculine cast and a strong focus on combat, strategy, and teamwork. I’ve pretty much exhausted all the classic shonen. I’m a huge Dragon Ball fan, and for me, Dragon Ball is simply the greatest anime of all time. Nothing has ever truly replaced that feeling.\n\nBecause of that, I stopped watching anime for months. Most of the newer series feel overloaded with fan service, shallow characters, and recycled concepts. There’s often no real depth, no long-term vision, no sense that the story actually wants to say something. It all feels like cheap, flashy copies, and I completely lost interest.\n\nThen I started World Trigger.\n\nAnd I can’t describe it any other way, this anime is a hidden gem. It’s one of the best discoveries I’ve made in years. It’s rare that I find an anime that genuinely makes me want to keep watching episode after episode, not because of cheap hype, but because of how smart and well-structured it is.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how balanced and grounded the series feels. There’s no excessive fan service, no forced cringe moments, no empty spectacle. Instead, you get a serious story, a large and well-developed cast, and a world that feels coherent and carefully built. The fights aren’t just about screaming and power-ups either, they’re tactical and team-based. Every character matters. Even the weaker characters have a role, and intelligence often matters more than raw strength.\n\nI’m almost done with the anime at this point, and I genuinely don’t understand how World Trigger isn’t way more popular. Honestly, why did nobody tell me about this anime earlier? I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time, and it feels like I randomly stumbled onto it when it should’ve been a name everyone recommends right away.\n\nI also heard there might be a reboot or some kind of return with new episodes. I’m not sure if that means the anime is actually continuing, but if it’s true, that’s amazing news. This is exactly the kind of series that deserves to keep going.\n\nI just wanted to put this out there for anyone who, like me, feels burned out by modern anime trends. World Trigger is not another trash copy. It’s thoughtful, intense, and a real pleasure to watch. For me, it’s genuinely a sublime anime, and I’m glad I finally found it.",

Given how long One Piece has been running for and how many episodes it has (more than even the Simpsons at this point, despite making its debut a decade afterwards), it would seem the choice to watch either subbed or dubbed is a massive commitment.

There are two characters, a furry (I'm guessing a cat) with white fur and pink ears and a younger dude, I think he had darker hair, possilby blue. They were standing in a dark room, where the only source of light is the furries computer. The furry wanted to show the boy something on her computer, but when she opened something on it (I'm guessing a browser) there was a video of to cats fucking. The furry immidietly turns it off and after a bit of silence the guy does the classic confused scream.\nIf any of you recognise what I just described and know the show, please tell what it is.

    "text": "World Trigger, Where Have You Been? I just wanted to share my point of view on an anime I recently discovered, because honestly, it caught me completely off guard.\n\nFor a long time, I’ve been searching for an anime that really clicks with me again, especially something with a very masculine cast and a strong focus on combat, strategy, and teamwork. I’ve pretty much exhausted all the classic shonen. I’m a huge Dragon Ball fan, and for me, Dragon Ball is simply the greatest anime of all time. Nothing has ever truly replaced that feeling.\n\nBecause of that, I stopped watching anime for months. Most of the newer series feel overloaded with fan service, shallow characters, and recycled concepts. There’s often no real depth, no long-term vision, no sense that the story actually wants to say something. It all feels like cheap, flashy copies, and I completely lost interest.\n\nThen I started World Trigger.\n\nAnd I can’t describe it any other way, this anime is a hidden gem. It’s one of the best discoveries I’ve made in years. It’s rare that I find an anime that genuinely makes me want to keep watching episode after episode, not because of cheap hype, but because of how smart and well-structured it is.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how balanced and grounded the series feels. There’s no excessive fan service, no forced cringe moments, no empty spectacle. Instead, you get a serious story, a large and well-developed cast, and a world that feels coherent and carefully built. The fights aren’t just about screaming and power-ups either, they’re tactical and team-based. Every character matters. Even the weaker characters have a role, and intelligence often matters more than raw strength.\n\nI’m almost done with the anime at this point, and I genuinely don’t understand how World Trigger isn’t way more popular. Honestly, why did nobody tell me about this anime earlier? I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time, and it feels like I randomly stumbled onto it when it should’ve been a name everyone recommends right away.\n\nI also heard there might be a reboot or some kind of return with new episodes. I’m not sure if that means the anime is actually continuing, but if it’s true, that’s amazing news. This is exactly the kind of series that deserves to keep going.\n\nI just wanted to put this out there for anyone who, like me, feels burned out by modern anime trends. World Trigger is not another trash copy. It’s thoughtful, intense, and a real pleasure to watch. For me, it’s genuinely a sublime anime, and I’m glad I finally found it.",

    "text": "Scarlet (2025) Review - LIGHT SPOILER So I watched Scarlet here in \\[REDACTED\\] and I must say.... it's a good animated film.\n\nIt made me cry like 6-7 times throughout the film but I'm a bit emotional person with certain aspects of the film.\n\nI'm not gonna' say the full details of the film like from start to finish, only the general.  \n  \n**1. The animation?**  \nI liked it even it's 3D/CGI (but there are parts where it will be 2D animated on certain scenes).  \nI also like the action and the close quarter fights of Scarlet.\n\n**2. The characters?**  \nI liked them, especially Scarlet and her counterpart in the film, Hijiri. Hijiri acts as a contrast to Scarlet, being what Scarlet would describe as a \"**good doer**.\"   \n  \nThroughout the film, Scarlet changes because of him.\n\n**3. The music?**  \nIt was good/alright, I don't really have anything to say as I'm not really good at explaining regarding with this aspect.\n\n**4. The plot?**  \nIt was alright.   \nScarlet's journey is a quest of revenge but overtime she questions the nature of it. At some point she says these things along the lines of...  \n  \n***\"What was the point of my life?\"***  \n***\"Why did he say that despite of how despicable that person who did this to us?\"***  \n***\"After I completed my revenge, I want to disappear\"***\n\nAt the end of the film, she have 2 choices:  \n**Forgive or Revenge.**\n\nShe struggles with this, although forgiveness may not be ***in the way one would think***.\n\nSome parts maybe cliche but i don't really mind them.\n\n**Overall, it's a 8/10 film. I would recommend it just the right amount.**\n\nThis is like at the end of Scarlet:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uotuuw1xiq6g1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7c607e612cac74a61e9d326c7c75183ce345572\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr29xc3xiq6g1.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d517d74a2f93ebe0dacbbd99a614fb72fda7343",

    "text": "World Trigger, Where Have You Been? I just wanted to share my point of view on an anime I recently discovered, because honestly, it caught me completely off guard.\n\nFor a long time, I’ve been searching for an anime that really clicks with me again, especially something with a very masculine cast and a strong focus on combat, strategy, and teamwork. I’ve pretty much exhausted all the classic shonen. I’m a huge Dragon Ball fan, and for me, Dragon Ball is simply the greatest anime of all time. Nothing has ever truly replaced that feeling.\n\nBecause of that, I stopped watching anime for months. Most of the newer series feel overloaded with fan service, shallow characters, and recycled concepts. There’s often no real depth, no long-term vision, no sense that the story actually wants to say something. It all feels like cheap, flashy copies, and I completely lost interest.\n\nThen I started World Trigger.\n\nAnd I can’t describe it any other way, this anime is a hidden gem. It’s one of the best discoveries I’ve made in years. It’s rare that I find an anime that genuinely makes me want to keep watching episode after episode, not because of cheap hype, but because of how smart and well-structured it is.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how balanced and grounded the series feels. There’s no excessive fan service, no forced cringe moments, no empty spectacle. Instead, you get a serious story, a large and well-developed cast, and a world that feels coherent and carefully built. The fights aren’t just about screaming and power-ups either, they’re tactical and team-based. Every character matters. Even the weaker characters have a role, and intelligence often matters more than raw strength.\n\nI’m almost done with the anime at this point, and I genuinely don’t understand how World Trigger isn’t way more popular. Honestly, why did nobody tell me about this anime earlier? I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time, and it feels like I randomly stumbled onto it when it should’ve been a name everyone recommends right away.\n\nI also heard there might be a reboot or some kind of return with new episodes. I’m not sure if that means the anime is actually continuing, but if it’s true, that’s amazing news. This is exactly the kind of series that deserves to keep going.\n\nI just wanted to put this out there for anyone who, like me, feels burned out by modern anime trends. World Trigger is not another trash copy. It’s thoughtful, intense, and a real pleasure to watch. For me, it’s genuinely a sublime anime, and I’m glad I finally found it.",

I prefer to watch shows with more than 2 seasons so I know there is hope for more seasons. Are there any suggestions you guys can give me that fit the same types of these shows?

I've been trying to get into older anime recently and a few days I had a thought \n\nMy favorite genre of anime is slice of life so I should try to find some old slice of life anime but I couldn't find many\n\nThen I remembered that world masterpiece theater exists so I am thinking of watching some of them (I've watched some when I was a child) \n\nBut other than that and some Ghibli movies I couldn't find any from the 80s and 90s, just imagining an anime that has the cozy vibe of laid back camp with the retro cell animation of the 80s and 90s just feels like it would be perfect \n\nAlso it doesn't have to be the cozy relaxing kind of slice of life anime, some drama is good too although I would prefer it not be romance but it's fine if it is, I really like the KyoAni kind of slice of life and the early 2010s P.A works slice of life anime.",

There are two characters, a furry (I'm guessing a cat) with white fur and pink ears and a younger dude, I think he had darker hair, possilby blue. They were standing in a dark room, where the only source of light is the furries computer. The furry wanted to show the boy something on her computer, but when she opened something on it (I'm guessing a browser) there was a video of to cats fucking. The furry immidietly turns it off and after a bit of silence the guy does the classic confused scream.\nIf any of you recognise what I just described and know the show, please tell what it is. I'm way too intrestead in it. Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "Whoever voted for Donald Trump is an idiot. **\\*WARNING: POLITICAL RANT!\\***\n\nTL;DR: I heavily dislike Donald Trump because he's an idiot\n\nLike, the dude gave off dictator vibes before he even came President. I understand that most men nowadays are right-wing and they like Trump because he's conservative, but like... Trump literally looks evil; he sounds like how a dictator would talk. You ever heard of the German dictator from the 1940s? That's what Trump reminds me of. Both came to power in a democratic system and turns the country into a totalitarian regime. Although Trump hasn't done that yet, but I am predicting that he will because Trump is a fascist. Now, just because I hate Trump doesn't mean I'm a Democrat either. I don't know much about Kamala Harris, but I think she's an idiot too. Anyway, the people who voted for Trump are the reason democracy in the United States will end. Yes, there are checks and balances to ensure a President doesn't become too powerful, but Trump is a smart guy, I reckon he'll figure out how to serve a third term and eventually become a dictator like President Vladimir Putin. Also, I don't like Kamala Harris either, but I think she would've had a better foreign policy than Trump. A United States under Harris would likely help out Ukraine a lot more, and America would ramp up military aid to Ukraine. Also, Trump's foreign policy is just dogshit. Slapping tariffs on all your allies will just make them resent you, and it will ruin America not just economically, but it will leave the US isolated because nobody wants to be allies with a country that gives them tariffs. To the people who voted for Donald Trump: you will be the reason we'll have World War III.",

I said that a more fitting punishment would be either torture or experimenting on them (in the same way pharmaceutical companies do animal testing), and someone said that it was “inhumane” and “unethical” to do human experimentation on them… but I said that… they arent human. Most of my friends agree with me but this one person started crashing out at me saying I had “extremist views” (I also said to them that we should kill all CEOs, which I think is reasonable) and now I think they hate me. Am I in the wrong here or is what I said justified?",

We both have had sex for a while and while my parents know for sure im not sure if his does. Main point is, his stepmom won’t let him sleep over despite it being clearly the easier option sometimes. Rather having him drive at 12am or 3am home drowsy than letting him stay. He has given up on the idea of asking and is waiting to just move out (in this economy???) and when i asked she shamed him for having me ask (despite that not being what happened). All my friends/roommates have slept in the same bed as their significant other and even my mom who is understanding to strict parents think it weird she (stepmom) tries to dictate what happens in my dorm. So like what can i do?? I really want to get high with him but i cant let him drive like that obvi\n\nTldr: i want to sleep in the same bed as my bf but his stepmom wont let him go what i do??",

I think the use of it as slang *already* makes it less of a word with historical baggage, (I think if people didn't use it as slang it would be the equavilent of calling somebody a nazi.) people censor it even when it isn't targeted at someone. people are considered \"racist\" if they say this word, even if they say it with absoloutely no malicous intent. in media, (such as youtube) white people say the n-word but censor it, while making it clear to the audience its used. it's not the word itself, it's the baggage, and that's what's hard for people to understand. I have also seen such lengths of media making ai use the word, so the people themselves don't, so \"its not racist\". the bottom of the barrel is the concept of \"n-word passes\" which is so stupid I don't even need to explain it. if we can look at the closest example, nazis and jews, jews will sometimes joke about them as dark humor. but it isn't anywhere near the normilization of the word, so much that the word itself is considered taboo rather than the actual racism connected to it.",

I was also captivated by train safety. I'd always read the fire exit directions and the warnings about the electrical hazards of the railroad. I also drew out my own train safety comics all the time (labelled with accurate information btw) 😂😂 \n\nOh yeah and I was also OBSESSED with train safety videos on YouTube, and I can recite the script of several of them just from the sheer amount of times I used to rewatch the same ones... Also none of this was out of fear. I was just weirdly fascinated...\n\nI still often read the labels and warning signs on stuff.\n\nAlso I don't think I have autism. All my social interactions have always been fine, I've never had abnormal reactions to things etc...",

Sonography is my heads dream job but band is my hearts dream and has been my dream since I was 6. I am musically talented playing 5 instruments well and I spend my free time practicing. My dream college accepted me but I turned it down due to distance and my current one is local so it was more convenient however I am able to re apply since they take any age. At my current college I am doing a level maths, English, and biology. Despite me doing well in the lessons, keep getting hit with fails. I am neurodiverse and My current college aren’t in a rush to help me with anything and it just makes me miserable. The only thing keeping me there is my friends and the fact that sonography is a realistic career path and music is just a fantasy and i probably won’t end up successful due to the unstable industry. My current college want to kick me out soon due to missed assignments I have caught up on but they don’t care I just feel like they are trying to make me leave since they make me feel like an inconvenience to teach and I’ve had enough I just want to quit however I know that won’t get me far pls what do I do",

Right slant.\n\nRedaction:\n\nTrump's had the H redacted out of the Epstein files. This makes me wonder if whole pictures were blacked out or not included as part of the redaction.  Also, why are the girl's faces redacted? Victims faces were redacted.\n\nBannon:\n\nSteve Bannon, Prince Andrew, Trump and Epstein had a \"circle\" of \"friends\" going. There are a lot of pictures of these guys together, and email trains. Trump admitted in 2002 in the New York Magazine article about Epstein that Trump and Epstein were very good friends for over 15 years. There are a lot of pictures of these guys together, and Bannon was acting as intermediary between Trump and Epstein, communicating with Epstein, asking him questions for ideas for the Trump campaign.\n\nAlexander Acosta:\n\nTrump rewarded Alexander Acosta with a top position for nearly letting Epstein off in 2008. The prosecutor directly on the case complained that Acosta had intervened to cause Epstein's sentence to be extremely light.\n\nThe photo of Clinton is most likely from a charity event. Most of the Epstein interaction with Clinton links to charity events, including flying to foreign countries together with Chris Tucker for AIDS charities.\n\nRight wing propaganda will cover this up.\n\nMy sub: [r/TrumpMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpMusic/)",

I'm in a dispute with a dealer and interested to hear what the community has to say. \n\nMy rear subframe is damaged at the control arm mount due to the bolt not being correctly tightened during the last wheel alignment (prior to purchase and about 2 years since alignment was done). \n\nIs it common or possible for the bolt to loosen with normal operation and cause gradual damage. \nWould a sub 5kmh nose to tail potentially cause it to loosen ( drive thru and stepped on gas by accident with about 0.5m travel to impact). \n\nMy argument is that the last time the bolt was touched was the wheel alignment before my purchase, and that it doesn't just gradually get loose over time, therefore it had to have happened at the alignment. \n\nThe Toyota mech stated as much too.",

It’s not safe to have a child’s car seat in the front seat, and I don’t even know if it’s legal. But the front seat still has an ALR seatbelt that gets locked/has the retraction feature engaged if an adult passenger leans forward just enough to adjust the air vent or reach for anything. Once this happens the only way for the passenger to free themself from the seatbelt’s death grip is to take their seatbelt off entirely and let it retract all the way.

I do have to pull the gearbox in half anyway to redo the gasket, but I wanted to avoid moving anything- is there a way to do this as well?\n\nI can send more pictures if required,\n\npls help!😱\n\n(I'm new to reddit-if this is the wrong place pls recommend me to another",

I tripled checked the wires to make sure they were popped on all the way and took out and inspected the acdelco spark plugs which all looked fine. I’ve got it all back together now and it’s still doing it. What do you guys think? Faulty plugs? Bad wires? Ignition coil packs? Thanks all for the help.",

The red arrow seems to be where the jack goes into.

Would it be safe to try to get my axle stand under the same seam I jacked up on, and then repeat the same on the other side of the front wheel? \n\nOr should I locate another point (outside the manual) to initially jack up, and place the axle stands under the recommended seams? \n\nThanks in advance.",

    "text": "P0300 help 2003 corvette Hey guys I recently decided to do spark plugs and wires on my 2003 corvette 45k miles. The first time I fired it up it idled smooth for about a minute then check engine light popped on and I got a tremor. I assumed it was the cheap wires I bought so I overnighted the red ACDelco ones. After putting those on I started it up and had the same problem. Smooth idle for about a minute then a tremor and code. Could it be the ignition coil packs? I tripled checked the wires to make sure they were popped on all the way and took out and inspected the acdelco spark plugs which all looked fine. I’ve got it all back together now and it’s still doing it. What do you guys think? Faulty plugs? Bad wires? Ignition coil packs? Thanks all for the help.",

Power steering (eps) is intermittent. Cruise control will not turn on. Flashing pressure light intermittent as well. Store already warrantied out the first alternator but both new alternators have same issues occuring. \n\nLocal shop cleared obd computer errors (those came back). Took to dealership for diag: They measured 17.7v and claimed we need a Toyota alternator. Or unknown hours of electrical diag at hourly labor prices... \n\nMy questions: \n1. Does this car truly need a Toyota official alternator or is that just the dealerships way of selling parts during the process of elimination. \n\n2. If it's some other electrical issue, how can I go about diagnosing and replacing components to fix this. I don't even know where to start on troubleshooting. \n\n3. Has anyone seen similar issues like this? What was the problem? \n\nI don't trust the dealership to try and save me money, and I don't have dealership repair money this close to christmas. \n\n2011 Toyota Sienna LE, 3.5L v6, 230,000 miles",

For the last several months, it was squealing and rattling a little but would go away after warming up. Decided it had to be the tensioner…didn’t even look at the other pulley 🤡 Felt like a dummy when I finally took a closer look. Changed them out today and thought, after years of getting your free advice as a lurker, I owed you a chance to roast me. \n\nFirst question: The new duralast set came with what seems to be an adapter (pic 2) for smaller bolts or different mounting. I went ahead and mounted it and everything looks good (pic 3) but want to make sure I wasn’t supposed to use it in some way I’m not aware of - am I good to toss this because the lineup looks correct?\n\nSecond question: old belt looks to be in good shape. Worth keeping as a backup, or is there some wear on it I’m not seeing? Pic 4 shows the condition and it’s the same all over. \n\nThanks!",

While I have wanted a manual swap for this car, this is NOT the way I expected it ha ha!\n\n\n\nI know these transmissions are a time bomb, but I have been servicing this one regularly, fluid seems OKAY for 192k on the clock.

    "text": "Advice Needed for Land Rover Heating Issue I have (regrettably) a 2016 Discovery Sport that’s experiencing issues with the heat at the moment. The heating system has suddenly become very inconsistent. There are times I turn on the blower and nothing comes out despite it being on. Then randomly as I’m driving it’ll turn on or I’ll hit the area above the vents and it’ll instantly start up.\n\nI took it to a local shop where I get most of my automotive maintenance done and they couldn’t replicate the issue on that day. The blower worked as they tried to figure out the issue. His recommendation was to wait on it to see if the issue worsens because he doesn’t want to blindly tell me it needs a new blower motor when it could end up being another issue.\n\nToday I took it to Land Rover for a second opinion and was told it needs a new blower motor. The cost to replace it through them would be $2000. They also told me that even after replacing the blower motor there’s a chance it could be something else that’s contributing to it not working in the first place, like faulty wiring.\n\nI called the local shop I originally took it to and told him my situation. He said a new blower motor installed through them would be $1000. However, he still suggested I hold off for a while because there’s no guarantee the blower motor is the sole issue and I could easily end up shelling out thousands for some of the other components if any of them are the culprits.\n\nI need some advice on what to do. I’ve shelled out thousands of dollars every year on maintenance since I bought this car 4 years ago. Every year there seems to be a new issue.",

Took to dealership to have them scan it and it gave me codes B0012 and B0013. Paperwork says deployment loop high resistance and the light has been turning on and off. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. High resistance and intermittent would indicate that something isn't connected properly. Probing the connections in the steering wheel should be next step?\n\n2. Would the issue be the impact sensors in the front? I find it strange but idk. Is there a way I can rule them out without replacing first?\n\n\nEDIT* Found this link: see comment as I can't post it for some reason\n\nIn the circuit system description, it says SDM checks for proper circuit continuity. I assume it does this every time car is on correct? I say this because that would lead to being impact sensors being the more likely culprit than inside the steering wheel? Could it be faulty connection at the impact sensor due to the scuffing incident?\n\n\nEDIT 2* Sorry for the spit balling but I think it has to be inside steering wheel as impact sensor isn't part of the deployment loop.",

Hello, r/AskHistorians,\n\nI'm writing a short story set in a rural Irish Catholic parish around 1908. I'm particularly interested in understanding the day-to-day life and responsibilities of a young curate in a small town at this time.\n\nWhat were the typical dynamics between a parish priest and his curate? What would confession have been like from the priest's perspective? How would parishioners have interacted with clergy in daily life?\n\nI'm also curious about the broader community: economic conditions, how people made a living, common superstitions or folk beliefs that coexisted with Catholicism, and the general role and authority of priests in small communities.\n\nI'd also appreciate any recommendations for primary sources (memoirs, letters, parish records) or academic works that discuss Irish Catholic clergy and rural life in this period.",

    "text": "How is Carl Oglesby's \"Yankee and Cowboy War\" framework viewed by modern political historians? Is this model of elite factionalism still used to analyze the 1960s-70s realignments? Evening all,\n\nI have been reading about the structural analysis of 20th-century US politics, specifically the theory proposed by Carl Oglesby and others (like Peter Dale Scott) regarding the \"Yankee vs. Cowboy\" war.\n\nThis model posits that much of the political turbulence from 1960 to 1980 was not just partisan (Democrat vs. Republican), but a factional struggle between:\n\nThe \"**Yankees**\" (Eastern Establishment): Old money, Wall Street, and Ivy League institutions favoring globalism, détente, and stability.\n\nThe \"**Cowboys**\" (Sunbelt/South): New money, defense contractors, and oil interests favoring nationalism, military aggression, and deregulation.\n\nThe theory suggests that major events—from the internal conflicts of the LBJ/Nixon administrations to the Watergate scandal—can be viewed as \"**Deep Politics**\" or factional power struggles (e.g., the \"Yankee\" institutions like the FBI/WaPo moving against the \"Cowboy\" Nixon White House).\n\nMy questions are:\n\nDo mainstream US historians engage with this \"Capital Faction\" model today, or is it largely relegated to \"fringe\" / \"conspiratorial\" history?\n\nIs there a difference in how US historians view this period compared to non-US scholars (e.g., European or Soviet/Russian historians)? It seems that foreign scholars might be more willing to analyze the US as an oligarchy of warring elites, whereas US historians focus more on the \"Open Air\" democratic process and public archives.\n\nDoes the field acknowledge a bias regarding \"Archival Asymmetry\"—the idea that we view the USSR as a conspiracy because we have their secret Politburo archives, but view the US as an open democracy because corporate/lobbyist archives remain private?\n\nLastly, if this model is accepted, how do historians reconcile the structural power of these factions with the popular narrative of American democracy? Do scholars explicitly describe this period as a form of \"Elite Pluralism\" - or go even as far as \"Gangster Capitalism\" - or is there a tension in the field between the procedural history (voting) and the structural history (capital factions)?\n\nI am interested in whether this model has any traction in the current historical consensus. I would say it definitely sounds like Leftist polemics but I know leftist analysis has been known to successfully challenge areas of history (Eric Foner, William Appleman Williams) so I wanted to check with you all first before checking my skepticism.\n\nI appreciate you all!

    "text": "(Brasil) Help identifying Fordlândia worker badge (CFIB) – meaning of letter prefixes C, F, and B? Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a History undergraduate student researching Ford’s operations in the Brazilian Amazon, specifically Fordlândia and Belterra. I’ve come across a historical object that has become central to my research: a worker badge with the inscription “CFIB” (Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil) and the code C1015.\n\nWhile investigating this badge, I found several others online with the same CFIB inscription, but with different letter prefixes (such as C, F, and B). However, I haven’t been able to find any examples with the letter “I,” even though “I” is part of the acronym CFIB.\n\nHere’s the issue:\n\nThe Benson Ford Research Center (the main Ford archive in the U.S.) told me they have very limited information about Ford badges, especially those from Brazil, and found no documentation explaining these letter codes.\n\nHistorian Greg Grandin (author of Fordlândia) replied to my email saying he believes “CFIB” simply stood for Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil, but he didn’t have further information on the badge classification system.\n\nI’ve collected various badge images from collectors and online sources, and all of them follow the same pattern:\nLetters used = C, F, and B\nLetters NOT used = I (so far)\n\n\nThis suggests a possible internal classification system unique to the Amazon operations — potentially different from the U.S. plants, where badge letters typically indicated departments.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Has anyone seen documentation, manuals, or internal records explaining the badge system used by CFIB in Fordlândia or Belterra?\n\n\n2. Do the letters C, F, and B correspond to specific worker categories, divisions, or geographic sectors within the Amazon operations?\n\n\n3. Does anyone know whether Ford used simplified or local identification systems for overseas plants that differed from U.S. practices?\n\n\n4. Has anyone ever come across CFIB badges beginning with the letter I?\n\n\n\nAny leads — archival references, collector knowledge, photos, catalogues, or personal stories — would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nPedro\nFederal University of Pará (UFPA), Brazil",

Reading about the history of the SAS and its origins in Africa, it seems that their operations were largely hit and run sabotage missions where few, if any, prisoners were taken. After the Dieppe raid however, Hitler issued the commando order directing that any captured Allied commandos would be executed regardless of whether they were in uniform or not (if not in uniform they were generally executed by both sides). The justification for this order was the alleged execution of bound German prisoners at Dieppe, and the recovery of an order given to Canadian troops to “bind German prisoners”. Was there any truth to the allegations that commandos would kill bound or otherwise surrendered German prisoners? Was this order borne solely out of fear or did the Germans actually have evidence that commandos would do the same to their prisoners?",

My book tells the stories of a dozen radical Protestant English women, including a Colchester woman who feared that her four children would starve to death and a former maidservant from Yorkshire who was granted an audience with the sultan of the Ottoman Empire. These women believed in spiritual equality, and this belief empowered them to resist the status quo, questioning the authority of those who sought to lord it over them. From mostly humble backgrounds, they found ways to make their voices heard, creating some of the earliest autobiographical accounts in English and allowing us a rare glimpse of the lives and experiences of women in the early modern era.\n\nI'm here to answer questions about the book and about radical religious women of the 17th century, so AMA!",

But I’m having trouble finding any information on a certain person and thought I’d post something here and hope it reaches anyone that might know anything. \n\nBasically I’m trying to figure out if there was a Flathead tribe chief or sub-chief named “Coon-Coon-Staine” from any time around roughly the 1790s-1860s?  As I haven’t been able to come up with anything. I believe that “coon-coon-staine” could very well be a phonetic spelling non-native people came up with instead of what his name actually was. \n\nAngelic “Cah-kats-tsee” Tecumsh Tellier, born around 1820 in Idaho and died January 7th 1913 in st Ignatius, Montana. Was the wife of Louis tellier, they married in 1844. It seems she was Pend d'Oreille. \n\nI was debunking the idea that she’s the daughter of Tecumseh since he died before she was born. A lot of people seem to think she is his daughter. But while doing so I did find a pdf compiled by the “Frazier Farmstead Museum” that in the bottom paragraph of the 7th page states that Angelic is the Niece of “Coon-Coon-Staine” and that he was a “chief of the flatheads” \n\nI just want to make sure this tree is as accurate as I can make it. And maybe learn a thing or two in the process. Thank you for reading! \n\nHere is the source for the pdf I was referring to in case that helps. ⬇️\n\nhttp://www.frazierfarmsteadmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Descendants-of-Louis-Sr-Tellier.pdf",

By the time Fascism had risen to power in Italy in 1922, Italy already had colonies such as Libya and Eritrea. Their control of the colonies before Fascist rule had already been justified by a colonial era form of paternalistic racism that considered Italy a \"civilising force\" similar to what France did in its African and Asian colonies.\n\nWhat my question is that was racism in Fascist Italy significantly reinforced by the presence of Fascist ideology? As we know, fascism inherently requires the \"other\" to fight against in order to reinforce national unity and superiority. To my knowledge, the \"other\" was defenitely political minorities such as the communists but I wonder were ethnic minorities suppresed in Fascist Italy in a way that was justified ideologically and whether was this even more \"malicious\" than Italy's pre-existing racism before Fascism?",

While I admit I have not yet read it, I did read his [AMA on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pewzau/ama_i_am_alex_wellerstein_historian_of_science/) and listened to his interview by [Dan Carlin](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history-addendum/id1326393257?i=1000738846837) on his podcast.\n\nIf I may briefly summarize part of his argument in the book, he proposes that Truman didn’t fully understand what bombing Hiroshima meant when he approved it. He thought in agreeing with Secretary Stimson that Kyoto was off the list, he was eliminating “bombing a city” and that the remaining targets were military in nature. Once he realized what had happened, he was horrified. Further, he didn’t really realize that Nagasaki was happening immediately after, and once that was done, he issued the order that no other atomic bombs were to be dropped without his explicit order. Professor /u/restricteddata, please correct me if you see this and I’ve misstated your views!\n\nAs a layperson I thought this was extremely interesting and it certainly upended my understanding of the man and his relationship with these awful weapons.\n\nI would love to hear how these ideas are being received by historians with expertise in this area. Is this a new understanding or were these ideas actually mainstream among the professionals? If not, do people agree this research is compelling?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers!",

And, of course, does that concept fluctuate over time?\n\nThere is a common notion that Chinese officials and literati often regarded foreigners as 'barbarians', with this concept being equated in a vaccum with ancient greek ideas tied to the same term. What is made less clear by popular knowledge is what cultural signifiers were actually employed by Chinese societies to draw these lines. Is it the use of certain languages or is not being knowledgeable about certain canons of literature? Is it about being governed by chinese style institutions or not being, specifically, under institutions which formed the various Chinese empires? Does ethnicity, local religion, tribal allegiances and so on all play a role? And does being under the indirect influence of China's politics ameliorates one's status as a barbarian or not? Or is it entirely arbitrary, with the predisposition of Chinese officials to distance themselves from foreigners dictated by political priorities?\n\nSince such factors tend to fluctuate over time, I imagine that a comparative history of Ming relations with the outside world would be a good stress test for this question. After all, the Ming are supposed to have gone from being a rather open and engaging government to a closed off, defensive one. Would Japanese be regarded as more, or less, 'barbaric' than farther off peoples during the time when the Chinese Empire saw it as a haven of pirates?\n\n  \nI realize this question is lots of questions into one, so please feel free to answer it in part to the best of your ability if you're so inclined.

In many late-antique sources (Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian) from the Eastern Mediterranean, Rome and North Africa, women’s public veiling appears to have regularly concealed part or all of the face (e.g., Dio Chrysostom on Tarsus, The book of Susanna (a book widely read by Christians at the time and even seen as canonical and is still considered canonical today by many churches including: the Catholics, the Orthodox and other branches of Christianity) where Susanna was described as having a veiled face and being ordered to take her veil off, Jewish traditions of veiling, Tertullian, Ambrose of Milan, Clement of Alexandria, etc.).\n\nYet by the High Middle Ages and possibly even earlier the standard Christian practice (East and West) had become covering the hair only, with the face almost always visible.\n\nI believe there are some accounts of face veiling in the Byzantine empire (aka the Eastern Roman empire) but I'm not absolutely certain about this.\n\nMany attempt to say this face veiling were only for consecrated virgins, but many accounts describe married women as having to be veiled in this manner too and Tertullian indeed mentions against the Roman custom of that only matron women to be veiled in public and believed that unmarried women should be veiled too.\n\nI'm genuinely curious what caused this shift?",

    "text": "How has Alex Wellerstein‘s research in *The Most Awful Responsibility* been received by historians? [Alex Wellerstein](https://www.reddit.com/user/restricteddata/) recently published *The Most Awful Responsibility: Truman and the Secret Struggle for Control of the Atomic Age*. While I admit I have not yet read it, I did read his [AMA on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pewzau/ama_i_am_alex_wellerstein_historian_of_science/) and listened to his interview by [Dan Carlin](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history-addendum/id1326393257?i=1000738846837) on his podcast.\n\nIf I may briefly summarize part of his argument in the book, he proposes that Truman didn’t fully understand what bombing Hiroshima meant when he approved it. He thought in agreeing with Secretary Stimson that Kyoto was off the list, he was eliminating “bombing a city” and that the remaining targets were military in nature. Once he realized what had happened, he was horrified. Further, he didn’t really realize that Nagasaki was happening immediately after, and once that was done, he issued the order that no other atomic bombs were to be dropped without his explicit order. Professor /u/restricteddata, please correct me if you see this and I’ve misstated your views!\n\nAs a layperson I thought this was extremely interesting and it certainly upended my understanding of the man and his relationship with these awful weapons.\n\nI would love to hear how these ideas are being received by historians with expertise in this area. Is this a new understanding or were these ideas actually mainstream among the professionals? If not, do people agree this research is compelling?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers!",

Was early industrialization outcompeted by slavery and if so did that play a role in motivating abolition efforts? The observation in question about when industrialization occurred relative to abolition is focused on Brazil, the US, and the UK’s global efforts in abolishing the slave trade worldwide. \n\nAs a followup question, if true, would it therefore be accurate to say that industrializing governments at this time undertook these actions not because they were purely altruistic but rather that they actually had a tangible interest in defeating an institution that competed with their path of development?",

    "text": "How is Carl Oglesby's \"Yankee and Cowboy War\" framework viewed by modern political historians? Is this model of elite factionalism still used to analyze the 1960s-70s realignments? Evening all,\n\nI have been reading about the structural analysis of 20th-century US politics, specifically the theory proposed by Carl Oglesby and others (like Peter Dale Scott) regarding the \"Yankee vs. Cowboy\" war.\n\nThis model posits that much of the political turbulence from 1960 to 1980 was not just partisan (Democrat vs. Republican), but a factional struggle between:\n\nThe \"**Yankees**\" (Eastern Establishment): Old money, Wall Street, and Ivy League institutions favoring globalism, détente, and stability.\n\nThe \"**Cowboys**\" (Sunbelt/South): New money, defense contractors, and oil interests favoring nationalism, military aggression, and deregulation.\n\nThe theory suggests that major events—from the internal conflicts of the LBJ/Nixon administrations to the Watergate scandal—can be viewed as \"**Deep Politics**\" or factional power struggles (e.g., the \"Yankee\" institutions like the FBI/WaPo moving against the \"Cowboy\" Nixon White House).\n\nMy questions are:\n\nDo mainstream US historians engage with this \"Capital Faction\" model today, or is it largely relegated to \"fringe\" / \"conspiratorial\" history?\n\nIs there a difference in how US historians view this period compared to non-US scholars (e.g., European or Soviet/Russian historians)? It seems that foreign scholars might be more willing to analyze the US as an oligarchy of warring elites, whereas US historians focus more on the \"Open Air\" democratic process and public archives.\n\nDoes the field acknowledge a bias regarding \"Archival Asymmetry\"—the idea that we view the USSR as a conspiracy because we have their secret Politburo archives, but view the US as an open democracy because corporate/lobbyist archives remain private?\n\nLastly, if this model is accepted, how do historians reconcile the structural power of these factions with the popular narrative of American democracy? Do scholars explicitly describe this period as a form of \"Elite Pluralism\" - or go even as far as \"Gangster Capitalism\" - or is there a tension in the field between the procedural history (voting) and the structural history (capital factions)?\n\nI am interested in whether this model has any traction in the current historical consensus. I would say it definitely sounds like Leftist polemics but I know leftist analysis has been known to successfully challenge areas of history (Eric Foner, William Appleman Williams) so I wanted to check with you all first before checking my skepticism.\n\nI appreciate you all!

My book tells the stories of a dozen radical Protestant English women, including a Colchester woman who feared that her four children would starve to death and a former maidservant from Yorkshire who was granted an audience with the sultan of the Ottoman Empire. These women believed in spiritual equality, and this belief empowered them to resist the status quo, questioning the authority of those who sought to lord it over them. From mostly humble backgrounds, they found ways to make their voices heard, creating some of the earliest autobiographical accounts in English and allowing us a rare glimpse of the lives and experiences of women in the early modern era.\n\nI'm here to answer questions about the book and about radical religious women of the 17th century, so AMA!",

This question is inspired by a post I saw in a different subreddit.\n\nIf I am trying to emigrate to the Americas, how do I prepare and how much knowledge do I have? This is in a time where I would have to spend weeks on a ship to get there, and realistically I would never come back to my home country.\n\nDo I know about different countries/regions in the Americas, and do I have a fact-based preference on where I want to go (depending on the living conditions/job opprtunities/etc. there)? Am I free to decide where I want to go, or is there only one ship going to \"America\" that I have to take? How much do my options depend on my country of origin?\n\nHow much do I know about the everyday life of normal citizens in my intended destination? Have I ever heard any news regarding the normal population there? Or do I just believe in the \"American Dream\", without much critical thought?\n\nI think basically my question is how much of an unknown America would be, and how much of a shock it would be when I arrive and see the real circumstances.\n\nThank you!",

Forgive me for wordiness here, but I'd like to explain where I'm coming from so I get a \"most-precise\" answer or set of answers.\n\nPutting aside whether Lenin actually used the phrase himself, I've always been curious- especially as a Marxist myself (though by no means a Marxist-Leninist, tbh)- to what extent the phrase \"rings/rang true\", particularly within the early, fascist regimes of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy?  Like, to what extent has fascism been \"fully embraced\" by the 'bourgeoisie', rather than begrudgingly-accepted by such elites in certain times of crisis as, perhaps, a temporary response to a \"socialist threat\" supposedly getting \"out of hand\", in their minds?  Did capitalist elites \"love\" being under fascist rule (esp. insofar as fascist political elites \"kept workers/unions down\") , or did they long for a time when some degree of 'democracy' and/or \"free markets\" (at least, as they knew them in those days, pre-fascism) would come back and just accept fascist rule for the time being because it still allowed them some degree of corporate power and rule over their companies?\n\nAnd how did Marxist-Leninists and others who believe in the phrase, \"Fascism is capitalism in decay\" ever publicly come to terms with aspects of fascism that, perhaps, flew in the face of that notion?  Did any well-known Marxists or Marxist theorists ever publicly-challenge the notion of \"Fascism as capitalism in decay\", or has it been, more or less, a 'mainstay' within mainstream Marxist theory since Lenin's time?",

While I admit I have not yet read it, I did read his [AMA on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pewzau/ama_i_am_alex_wellerstein_historian_of_science/) and listened to his interview by [Dan Carlin](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history-addendum/id1326393257?i=1000738846837) on his podcast.\n\nIf I may briefly summarize part of his argument in the book, he proposes that Truman didn’t fully understand what bombing Hiroshima meant when he approved it. He thought in agreeing with Secretary Stimson that Kyoto was off the list, he was eliminating “bombing a city” and that the remaining targets were military in nature. Once he realized what had happened, he was horrified. Further, he didn’t really realize that Nagasaki was happening immediately after, and once that was done, he issued the order that no other atomic bombs were to be dropped without his explicit order. Professor /u/restricteddata, please correct me if you see this and I’ve misstated your views!\n\nAs a layperson I thought this was extremely interesting and it certainly upended my understanding of the man and his relationship with these awful weapons.\n\nI would love to hear how these ideas are being received by historians with expertise in this area.

Reading about the history of the SAS and its origins in Africa, it seems that their operations were largely hit and run sabotage missions where few, if any, prisoners were taken. After the Dieppe raid however, Hitler issued the commando order directing that any captured Allied commandos would be executed regardless of whether they were in uniform or not (if not in uniform they were generally executed by both sides). The justification for this order was the alleged execution of bound German prisoners at Dieppe, and the recovery of an order given to Canadian troops to “bind German prisoners”. Was there any truth to the allegations that commandos would kill bound or otherwise surrendered German prisoners? Was this order borne solely out of fear or did the Germans actually have evidence that commandos would do the same to their prisoners?",

    "text": "Were all foreigners 'equally' barbarian in Chinese history, specifically during the more open and more closed off periods of the Ming Dynasty? And, of course, does that concept fluctuate over time?\n\nThere is a common notion that Chinese officials and literati often regarded foreigners as 'barbarians', with this concept being equated in a vaccum with ancient greek ideas tied to the same term. What is made less clear by popular knowledge is what cultural signifiers were actually employed by Chinese societies to draw these lines. Is it the use of certain languages or is not being knowledgeable about certain canons of literature? Is it about being governed by chinese style institutions or not being, specifically, under institutions which formed the various Chinese empires? Does ethnicity, local religion, tribal allegiances and so on all play a role? And does being under the indirect influence of China's politics ameliorates one's status as a barbarian or not? Or is it entirely arbitrary, with the predisposition of Chinese officials to distance themselves from foreigners dictated by political priorities?\n\nSince such factors tend to fluctuate over time, I imagine that a comparative history of Ming relations with the outside world would be a good stress test for this question. After all, the Ming are supposed to have gone from being a rather open and engaging government to a closed off, defensive one. Would Japanese be regarded as more, or less, 'barbaric' than farther off peoples during the time when the Chinese Empire saw it as a haven of pirates?\n\n  \nI realize this question is lots of questions into one, so please feel free to answer it in part to the best of your ability if you're so inclined.

By the time Fascism had risen to power in Italy in 1922, Italy already had colonies such as Libya and Eritrea. Their control of the colonies before Fascist rule had already been justified by a colonial era form of paternalistic racism that considered Italy a \"civilising force\" similar to what France did in its African and Asian colonies.\n\nWhat my question is that was racism in Fascist Italy significantly reinforced by the presence of Fascist ideology? As we know, fascism inherently requires the \"other\" to fight against in order to reinforce national unity and superiority. To my knowledge, the \"other\" was defenitely political minorities such as the communists but I wonder were ethnic minorities suppresed in Fascist Italy in a way that was justified ideologically and whether was this even more \"malicious\" than Italy's pre-existing racism before Fascism?",

    "text": "Can anyone by any chance help me with this brick wall I’ve hit with my research? Brick wall with research.\n\nHello! I am a genealogist and have been fleshing out a family tree for somebody for a while now. But I’m having trouble finding any information on a certain person and thought I’d post something here and hope it reaches anyone that might know anything. \n\nBasically I’m trying to figure out if there was a Flathead tribe chief or sub-chief named “Coon-Coon-Staine” from any time around roughly the 1790s-1860s?  As I haven’t been able to come up with anything. I believe that “coon-coon-staine” could very well be a phonetic spelling non-native people came up with instead of what his name actually was. \n\nAngelic “Cah-kats-tsee” Tecumsh Tellier, born around 1820 in Idaho and died January 7th 1913 in st Ignatius, Montana. Was the wife of Louis tellier, they married in 1844. It seems she was Pend d'Oreille. \n\nI was debunking the idea that she’s the daughter of Tecumseh since he died before she was born. A lot of people seem to think she is his daughter. But while doing so I did find a pdf compiled by the “Frazier Farmstead Museum” that in the bottom paragraph of the 7th page states that Angelic is the Niece of “Coon-Coon-Staine” and that he was a “chief of the flatheads” \n\nI just want to make sure this tree is as accurate as I can make it. And maybe learn a thing or two in the process. Thank you for reading! \n\nHere is the source for the pdf I was referring to in case that helps. ⬇️\n\nhttp://www.frazierfarmsteadmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Descendants-of-Louis-Sr-Tellier.pdf",

    "text": "[META] Participate in a Cornell survey to study community norms and participation in r/AskHistorians In the past, r/AskHistorians has distributed a census when we’ve hit historic subscriber milestones, such as when we reached 500k and 1 million subscribers. More recently, we’ve decided to forgo that tradition in favour of events that are more “fun” (like when we offered [1.5 million free facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yfs7uh/askhistorians_has_hit_15_million_subscribers_to/) and [2 million free removals](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1aznalm/askhistorians_has_2_million_subscribers_to/)). \n\nHowever, all that fun has meant that it’s been awhile since we’ve collected information about our community. So I decided that I wanted to do another survey, but this time do it in a way that the results have statistical validity. I want it to contribute to the science of online communities, in addition to providing insights that are helpful to the r/AskHistorians moderation team and community members. I’m working with my colleagues at Cornell to do just that! If you are interested in participating in the survey the link can be found here: \n\n**https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7UJFVeDC5iYuXk2**\n\nThe survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete and will ask questions about your participation patterns in r/AskHistorians, why you participate(d), your perception of its community norms, your experience with algorithmically generated content and recommender systems, and demographic questions. We will not ask you for personally identifiable information. The survey has been approved by Cornell’s IRB (IRB0149466). \n\nPlease note: We have been using multiple recruitment methods to help us reach as many people as possible and so that we can ensure our results are valid. That means we have been randomly sampling people who have participated in the community (including people who have had posts removed and have been banned), and we will be taking out ads. **If you have already completed that survey, you do not need to do it again.** It is the same survey, and we thank you for your participation. **If you are seeing this post before checking your messages and want to take the survey, please check your chats first and use that link!** If you’ve only ever lurked, we are particularly interested in surveying you too! It’s hard to capture the perspectives of lurkers and you are also an integral part of online communities. \n\nIf you completed one of the pilot surveys we sent earlier this year, you’re more than welcome to complete the survey again, but it’s a similar survey aside from some changes we made based on your feedback and responses, for which we are so grateful! \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me on Reddit via DM, email sarah.gilbert@cornell.edu, or in this thread. Or, you can contact Cornell’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Participants at 607-255-6182 or access their website at https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/IRB.  \n\nWe will share survey results on r/AskHistorians and our website at citizensandtech.org when they’re ready! \n\nFinally, if your mod team is interested in doing a similar survey with your community, please reach out! My team would love to survey a variety of different subs!",

It is often said that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved many more lives than they themselves took because had the Japanese not surrendered the allies would've been forced to invade. From what I gather, there were many different estimates of potential casualties for operation downfall, and not all of them were even as high as what the atom bombs would inflict. Truman himself many not have been aware of the higher estimates when he approved the use of the bombs in July 1945, I cannot find any sources that prove he was. He did think their usage would at least *contribute* to forcing a surrender if we take potsdam into account. \n\nSo is there any veracity to the claims of high casualties for operation downfall or is that post war revisionism?

In many late-antique sources (Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian) from the Eastern Mediterranean, Rome and North Africa, women’s public veiling appears to have regularly concealed part or all of the face (e.g., Dio Chrysostom on Tarsus, The book of Susanna (a book widely read by Christians at the time and even seen as canonical and is still considered canonical today by many churches including: the Catholics, the Orthodox and other branches of Christianity) where Susanna was described as having a veiled face and being ordered to take her veil off, Jewish traditions of veiling, Tertullian, Ambrose of Milan, Clement of Alexandria, etc.).\n\nYet by the High Middle Ages and possibly even earlier the standard Christian practice (East and West) had become covering the hair only, with the face almost always visible.\n\nI believe there are some accounts of face veiling in the Byzantine empire (aka the Eastern Roman empire) but I'm not absolutely certain about this.\n\nMany attempt to say this face veiling were only for consecrated virgins, but many accounts describe married women as having to be veiled in this manner too and Tertullian indeed mentions against the Roman custom of that only matron women to be veiled in public and believed that unmarried women should be veiled too.\n\nI'm genuinely curious what caused this shift?",

    "text": "Were all foreigners 'equally' barbarian in Chinese history, specifically during the more open and more closed off periods of the Ming Dynasty? And, of course, does that concept fluctuate over time?\n\nThere is a common notion that Chinese officials and literati often regarded foreigners as 'barbarians', with this concept being equated in a vaccum with ancient greek ideas tied to the same term. What is made less clear by popular knowledge is what cultural signifiers were actually employed by Chinese societies to draw these lines. Is it the use of certain languages or is not being knowledgeable about certain canons of literature? Is it about being governed by chinese style institutions or not being, specifically, under institutions which formed the various Chinese empires? Does ethnicity, local religion, tribal allegiances and so on all play a role? And does being under the indirect influence of China's politics ameliorates one's status as a barbarian or not? Or is it entirely arbitrary, with the predisposition of Chinese officials to distance themselves from foreigners dictated by political priorities?\n\nSince such factors tend to fluctuate over time, I imagine that a comparative history of Ming relations with the outside world would be a good stress test for this question. After all, the Ming are supposed to have gone from being a rather open and engaging government to a closed off, defensive one. Would Japanese be regarded as more, or less, 'barbaric' than farther off peoples during the time when the Chinese Empire saw it as a haven of pirates?\n\n  \nI realize this question is lots of questions into one, so please feel free to answer it in part to the best of your ability if you're so inclined.

However, I haven’t been able to find any examples with the letter “I,” even though “I” is part of the acronym CFIB.\n\nHere’s the issue:\n\nThe Benson Ford Research Center (the main Ford archive in the U.S.) told me they have very limited information about Ford badges, especially those from Brazil, and found no documentation explaining these letter codes.\n\nHistorian Greg Grandin (author of Fordlândia) replied to my email saying he believes “CFIB” simply stood for Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil, but he didn’t have further information on the badge classification system.\n\nI’ve collected various badge images from collectors and online sources, and all of them follow the same pattern:\nLetters used = C, F, and B\nLetters NOT used = I (so far)\n\n\nThis suggests a possible internal classification system unique to the Amazon operations — potentially different from the U.S. plants, where badge letters typically indicated departments.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Has anyone seen documentation, manuals, or internal records explaining the badge system used by CFIB in Fordlândia or Belterra?\n\n\n2. Do the letters C, F, and B correspond to specific worker categories, divisions, or geographic sectors within the Amazon operations?\n\n\n3. Does anyone know whether Ford used simplified or local identification systems for overseas plants that differed from U.S. practices?\n\n\n4. Has anyone ever come across CFIB badges beginning with the letter I?\n\n\n\nAny leads — archival references, collector knowledge, photos, catalogues, or personal stories — would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nPedro\nFederal University of Pará (UFPA), Brazil",

    "text": "Was there any truth to German accusations of Allied commandos executing surrendered German prisoners? Reading about the history of the SAS and its origins in Africa, it seems that their operations were largely hit and run sabotage missions where few, if any, prisoners were taken. After the Dieppe raid however, Hitler issued the commando order directing that any captured Allied commandos would be executed regardless of whether they were in uniform or not (if not in uniform they were generally executed by both sides). The justification for this order was the alleged execution of bound German prisoners at Dieppe, and the recovery of an order given to Canadian troops to “bind German prisoners”. Was there any truth to the allegations that commandos would kill bound or otherwise surrendered German prisoners? Was this order borne solely out of fear or did the Germans actually have evidence that commandos would do the same to their prisoners?",

By the time Fascism had risen to power in Italy in 1922, Italy already had colonies such as Libya and Eritrea. Their control of the colonies before Fascist rule had already been justified by a colonial era form of paternalistic racism that considered Italy a \"civilising force\" similar to what France did in its African and Asian colonies.\n\nWhat my question is that was racism in Fascist Italy significantly reinforced by the presence of Fascist ideology? As we know, fascism inherently requires the \"other\" to fight against in order to reinforce national unity and superiority. To my knowledge, the \"other\" was defenitely political minorities such as the communists but I wonder were ethnic minorities suppresed in Fascist Italy in a way that was justified ideologically and whether was this even more \"malicious\" than Italy's pre-existing racism before Fascism?",

My book tells the stories of a dozen radical Protestant English women, including a Colchester woman who feared that her four children would starve to death and a former maidservant from Yorkshire who was granted an audience with the sultan of the Ottoman Empire. These women believed in spiritual equality, and this belief empowered them to resist the status quo, questioning the authority of those who sought to lord it over them. From mostly humble backgrounds, they found ways to make their voices heard, creating some of the earliest autobiographical accounts in English and allowing us a rare glimpse of the lives and experiences of women in the early modern era.\n\nI'm here to answer questions about the book and about radical religious women of the 17th century, so AMA!",

But I’m having trouble finding any information on a certain person and thought I’d post something here and hope it reaches anyone that might know anything. \n\nBasically I’m trying to figure out if there was a Flathead tribe chief or sub-chief named “Coon-Coon-Staine” from any time around roughly the 1790s-1860s?  As I haven’t been able to come up with anything. I believe that “coon-coon-staine” could very well be a phonetic spelling non-native people came up with instead of what his name actually was. \n\nAngelic “Cah-kats-tsee” Tecumsh Tellier, born around 1820 in Idaho and died January 7th 1913 in st Ignatius, Montana.

A lot of people seem to think she is his daughter.

    "text": "How is Carl Oglesby's \"Yankee and Cowboy War\" framework viewed by modern political historians? Is this model of elite factionalism still used to analyze the 1960s-70s realignments? Evening all,\n\nI have been reading about the structural analysis of 20th-century US politics, specifically the theory proposed by Carl Oglesby and others (like Peter Dale Scott) regarding the \"Yankee vs. Cowboy\" war.\n\nThis model posits that much of the political turbulence from 1960 to 1980 was not just partisan (Democrat vs. Republican), but a factional struggle between:\n\nThe \"**Yankees**\" (Eastern Establishment): Old money, Wall Street, and Ivy League institutions favoring globalism, détente, and stability.\n\nThe \"**Cowboys**\" (Sunbelt/South): New money, defense contractors, and oil interests favoring nationalism, military aggression, and deregulation.\n\nThe theory suggests that major events—from the internal conflicts of the LBJ/Nixon administrations to the Watergate scandal—can be viewed as \"**Deep Politics**\" or factional power struggles (e.g., the \"Yankee\" institutions like the FBI/WaPo moving against the \"Cowboy\" Nixon White House).\n\nMy questions are:\n\nDo mainstream US historians engage with this \"Capital Faction\" model today, or is it largely relegated to \"fringe\" / \"conspiratorial\" history?\n\nIs there a difference in how US historians view this period compared to non-US scholars (e.g., European or Soviet/Russian historians)? It seems that foreign scholars might be more willing to analyze the US as an oligarchy of warring elites, whereas US historians focus more on the \"Open Air\" democratic process and public archives.\n\nDoes the field acknowledge a bias regarding \"Archival Asymmetry\"—the idea that we view the USSR as a conspiracy because we have their secret Politburo archives, but view the US as an open democracy because corporate/lobbyist archives remain private?\n\nLastly, if this model is accepted, how do historians reconcile the structural power of these factions with the popular narrative of American democracy? Do scholars explicitly describe this period as a form of \"Elite Pluralism\" - or go even as far as \"Gangster Capitalism\" - or is there a tension in the field between the procedural history (voting) and the structural history (capital factions)?\n\nI am interested in whether this model has any traction in the current historical consensus. I would say it definitely sounds like Leftist polemics but I know leftist analysis has been known to successfully challenge areas of history (Eric Foner, William Appleman Williams) so I wanted to check with you all first before checking my skepticism.\n\nI appreciate you all!

Is there any definitive evidence of stuffed animal toys before Margarete Steiff started making hers?",

She says that there are little to no surviving references to or depictions of child rearing and when you add that infant mortality rates may have been as high as 2 in 3, she infers that late middle ages Europeans didn't love their children. I realized that people in the past not loving their children is something that I grew up knowing via cultural osmosis. This has not generally been a reliable source... Is it really true?",

    "text": "The day the decrement operator ran The words were direct: \"Due to a change in business requirements, your role has become redundant. Your services are no longer required, and your employment will end on \\[XYZ date\\].\" The time froze on the employee's clock.\n\nIt was the standard corporate script, delivered to a speechless employee, confirming the final fear. It proved the undeniable truth: the employee was simply a headcount. On that day, the system executed the decrement operator, --1, several thousands of times on the employee database.\n\nYears of proven track record were overshadowed by a shift in technology. If technology, which constantly receives updates, can become redundant, why should employees be any different? Employees are not products; they are bound to be discarded.\n\nThe capitalistic world celebrated their new billionaires (and soon, trillionaires), they never become redundant. The employee, however, remains a mere spectator to the drama.\n\nEmployees are told to rinse and repeat, and grind for 27 hours a day, but those 27 hours are insufficient. They must constantly upskill, unlearn, and relearn just to live. The law of \"survival of the fittest,\" a concept of nature, now turns against the very humans who built the technology. Humans have to survive against technology.\n\nThe cycle will continue: new people will work, new tech will emerge, and the next wave of us will be told to eat, sleep, work, and repeat—until the decrement operator runs again.\n\nHistory does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. Long live capitalism.",

    "text": "Is it weird my coworkers completely ignored a shoutout my boss gave me? It actually kinda hurt. So this might sound small, but it honestly bothered me more than I expected.\n\nYesterday, my boss shouted me out in our team group chat. It was really positive and specific praise about a project I worked hard on. She tagged me directly, and it was clear she put effort into acknowledging the work.\n\nOur team is very small, and usually when anyone gets a kudos or shoutout, the whole group reacts - hearts, congrats, emojis, all of that. I’m always one of the first people to hype others up, because that’s just how I am. I always like/react, congratulate, and show appreciation when people get recognized.\n\nBut when it was my turn?\n\nLiterally no one reacted.\n\nNot a single emoji except for one coworker (the only one I genuinely vibe with). Everyone else was online, saw it, and just… ignored it. Meanwhile, if you scroll up in the chat, everyone reacted to all the other shoutouts for other people.\n\nIt made me feel excluded and honestly embarrassed. Like everyone celebrated each other except me.\n\nFor context, I’m also the only Black person on the team. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but it does add another layer because I work extra hard to be approachable, warm, positive, and “easy” to work with - just so no one can twist my attitude or energy into a stereotype. I show up for people, I support them, and I genuinely try to keep the workplace vibe positive.\n\nSo yeah, it stung when nobody could give something as simple as a heart reaction back.\n\nI’m not saying they need to validate my work - my boss’s praise is ultimately what matters. But the contrast was loud. And it lowkey made me feel singled out or excluded.\n\nAt this point I’m thinking of pulling my energy back. No more overcompensating, no extra warmth, no small talk. I’ll be professional, get my work done, and that’s it. The only people I’m giving extra grace to are my boss and the one coworker who actually acknowledged me.\n\nMaybe I’m too sensitive, maybe it means nothing - but it honestly didn’t feel good.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\n\nIs this normal team behavior, or is it a red flag?",

I answered both questions fully and honestly, but that was it.\n\nFor context, I’ve been in leadership roles for almost 10 years. I came prepared to talk about my skills, my experience, and how I can contribute to the team. Instead, after those two questions, she told me I’m “not fit for the role.”\n\nThen she asked how I am and if I’m married. I told her I’m single, and she replied sarcastically, “Oh, you’re 35 and still single?” I didn’t even know how to respond. After that, she asked if I would prefer a rank-and-file job, which honestly felt like a slap in the face.\n\nIt hurts even more because yesterday was my birthday. I really hoped I’d receive good news or at least be treated with respect. Instead, I ended up crying. I haven’t had work since May. I’ve sent hundreds of applications, gone to only a few interviews, and sometimes reached final interviews but still no offer.

We shouldn’t be working this much, and it’s literally killing us In my corporation there are a lot of people who are noticeably overweight, especially higher ups.

This store alone has 50+ divided into 3 shifts “teams.” Most of my team gets it. We’re civil to each other but aren’t there to make friends. Only like 1 or 2 people are bootlickers “um it’s actually against company policy 🤓”-types and the rest of us actively avoid being paired with them. The problem for me is when the morning shift team arrives and I still have an hour left to work. They always wanna smile and ask how I’m doing and what not. I honestly ignore them so that maybe they’d get the hint, but they still try to talk to me after nearly a year with the company. Most of them are older 50’s+. Last week I was stocking like prepackaged meats, and this woman working online orders tried to tell me that some of the bacon had gone bad. I just looked at her with a deadpan expression. She lifted it up and was, “ew, this is yucky” and I wanted to tell her “yeah capitalism is gross tf you want me to do about it?”. She then goes to a coworker of hers and has them take it to waste/claims. I was so annoyed by that cause 1) the company doesn’t care 2) she isn’t my boss 3) I usually have time to do that type of stuff (cleaning/organizing) after I’m done with the freight I have to stock. It’s like a second priority if I have the time and usually do. Also, she could have taken it herself. My store is one of the better ones in the area and I’m usually in frozen where there’s mold in the back of the fridges. Trust me lady, corporate doesn’t care about the communities they serve and they certainly don’t care you’re doing your best. \n\nWhew.

Come to find my paycheck this morning didn’t have thanksgiving/Black Friday paid for, despite the company being closed for nationals holidays. Curious, I reached out to HR as to why this happened and I received a new PTO/holiday policy enacted in Jan 2025.\n\nThe new policy states that they don’t provide holiday/vacation hours until after the employee has worked one continuous year, and because I had a break in between longer than 45 days my previous time here means diddly poo. \n\nThis is the fun part, I asked \\*what\\* the reasoning for this new policy was and HR slave said she didn’t know, only that it was voted on by the executives. The six of them, in a room, taking away holidays and vacations but will never miss an opportunity pat themselves on the back reiterating what a “great company environment” they’re creating.\n\nYou know what?! I would’ve preferred the opposite. At least be honest that you took away a chunk of my paycheck to help fuel your ego. Fucking spineless bastards. \n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant, hope everyone has a better holiday than me!",

    "text": "Antiwork rant, this can’t be it I’m just posting to scream into the void. I work in the US nonprofit field and I am exhausted. I left my last job because it had an extremely toxic work environment where me and my colleagues were constantly being harassed by management. I changed jobs and I’m still in a situation where I have to basically fight to do my actual work. The work alone should be hard enough, but I can’t even really engage with the work itself because the environment is so suffocating. And I know in a lot of ways, I’m one of the lucky ones - salaried hybrid office job with minimal oversight. But it feels like these jobs are killing me from the inside out. \n\nThis can’t be it. The idea of having to ask permission to take time off or take care of a loved one or be a fucking human for the next 3 decades of my life feels insurmountable. We are forced to give jobs our youth, our energy, our bodies. And if we are lucky to live long enough and save enough money, then we can retire - when most of us are tired and burnt out and have lost interest in things that used to excite us. For people who are able to reach retirement and enjoy it, I am so happy for you because we all deserve that. But there are a lot of technically retired people that are suffering for a myriad of other reasons that stem from no longer working. \n\nAnd the double speak in these workplaces makes me want to rip my hair out. Some people, especially in management, really like to pretend that we don’t exist outside of our jobs, that things outside of work don’t affect our days, that the workplace is free from all the ducked up -isms that plague society. Like they will completely ignore the elephant in the room and pretend it just doesn’t exist when you bring it up. It honestly makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s like we aren’t speaking the same language or existing in the same reality. I can’t begin to imagine the psychological and societal damages this causes to people who go to work every day and just lie through their teeth and/or let horrible things happen in front of them over and over again on a daily basis. We are not well. \n\nI am exhausted and I am sad and I have so many working years ahead of me. And I hate how we are made to feel guilty about hating this because so many people don’t have access to work and are hardly surviving because of it. Like I should just suck it up cause at least I have some health insurance and can afford rent and food, at least for now. \n\nThis can’t be it. I want more for all of us. I want us all to be able to enjoy our lives fully, not just to spend our lives working to survive. I know I’m not the first or the last person to say this, but I’m just feeling particularly depressed about it all lately. End of rant, back to work.",

A very large private equity firm purchased our parent company ~2 years ago, and my life has been fucked since. For context, my role is in an HR function, and I’m mid-level management.\n\nIn the beginning, it was things that MOSTLY made sense like forming GBS (Global Business Service) units to support all of our brands, and standardizing processes. But as that was happening, plot twist! Half of those roles were now being outsourced to India.\n\nNow, a year and a half later, we’re almost finished transitioning out our fantastic domestic team (who had the joy of training their replacements), and the organization doesn’t care about the human capital cost and bites off more than it can chew on everything. Think, multiple, load-bearing system changes at the same time that are under resourced all while the off shoring is occurring too. Everything is constantly breaking and shifting under our feet. Every. Single. Day.\n\nI’ve been looking at other gigs - but honestly, I have zero faith left in the system. This was the best job in the beginning (been here 3.5 years), and it certainly isn’t the only one where corporate fuckery has been afoot. What do you do when your soul and wallet don’t align?\n\n•\t⁠a miserable worker bee 🐝",

I'm pretty pissed off, and am currently trying to decide if it's worth raising a stink about if it wins.

Deadlines that suddenly can’t move even though they magically do a week later.\n\nIt creates this background anxiety where you’re always bracing for something, even on normal days. You can’t fully relax because you’re waiting for the next ping that’s going to demand immediate attention for no real reason. I’ve noticed it follows me home too I’ll be off the clock but still feel tense, like I forgot something important.\n\nThe strange thing is, I recently realized I have some money saved up enough that I’m not in immediate danger if things go sideways and instead of feeling relieved it made me more aware of how unnecessary the stress culture is. The job isn’t saving lives. The urgency is mostly manufactured and yet it takes up so much mental space. I don’t hate working. I just hate working in an environment where panic is treated like productivity. I wish more workplaces understood that constant pressure doesn’t make people perform better it just makes them exhausted.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the fake urgency is more draining than the actual work itself?",

    "text": "The hardest part of my job isn’t the work, it’s the constant urgency over nothing What’s been wearing me down lately isn’t workload or long hours, it’s how everything at my job is treated like an emergency. Emails marked urgent that aren’t. Meetings called last minute that could’ve been a message. Deadlines that suddenly can’t move even though they magically do a week later.\n\nIt creates this background anxiety where you’re always bracing for something, even on normal days. You can’t fully relax because you’re waiting for the next ping that’s going to demand immediate attention for no real reason. I’ve noticed it follows me home too I’ll be off the clock but still feel tense, like I forgot something important.\n\nThe strange thing is, I recently realized I have some money saved up enough that I’m not in immediate danger if things go sideways and instead of feeling relieved it made me more aware of how unnecessary the stress culture is. The job isn’t saving lives. The urgency is mostly manufactured and yet it takes up so much mental space. I don’t hate working. I just hate working in an environment where panic is treated like productivity. I wish more workplaces understood that constant pressure doesn’t make people perform better it just makes them exhausted.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the fake urgency is more draining than the actual work itself?",

So this might sound small, but it honestly bothered me more than I expected.\n\nYesterday, my boss shouted me out in our team group chat. It was really positive and specific praise about a project I worked hard on. She tagged me directly, and it was clear she put effort into acknowledging the work.\n\nOur team is very small, and usually when anyone gets a kudos or shoutout, the whole group reacts - hearts, congrats, emojis, all of that. I’m always one of the first people to hype others up, because that’s just how I am. I always like/react, congratulate, and show appreciation when people get recognized.\n\nBut when it was my turn?\n\nLiterally no one reacted.\n\nNot a single emoji except for one coworker (the only one I genuinely vibe with). Everyone else was online, saw it, and just… ignored it. Meanwhile, if you scroll up in the chat, everyone reacted to all the other shoutouts for other people.\n\nIt made me feel excluded and honestly embarrassed. Like everyone celebrated each other except me.\n\nFor context, I’m also the only Black person on the team. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but it does add another layer because I work extra hard to be approachable, warm, positive, and “easy” to work with - just so no one can twist my attitude or energy into a stereotype. I show up for people, I support them, and I genuinely try to keep the workplace vibe positive.\n\nSo yeah, it stung when nobody could give something as simple as a heart reaction back.\n\nI’m not saying they need to validate my work - my boss’s praise is ultimately what matters. But the contrast was loud. And it lowkey made me feel singled out or excluded.\n\nAt this point I’m thinking of pulling my energy back. No more overcompensating, no extra warmth, no small talk. I’ll be professional, get my work done, and that’s it. The only people I’m giving extra grace to are my boss and the one coworker who actually acknowledged me.\n\nMaybe I’m too sensitive, maybe it means nothing - but it honestly didn’t feel good.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\n\nIs this normal team behavior, or is it a red flag?",

    "text": "Cried on my birthday after getting rejected in the final interview. I had my final interview yesterday with the Department Head, and it honestly left me devastated. She only asked me two questions: why I took Psychology and what the most difficult challenge I’ve encountered is. I answered both questions fully and honestly, but that was it.\n\nFor context, I’ve been in leadership roles for almost 10 years. I came prepared to talk about my skills, my experience, and how I can contribute to the team. Instead, after those two questions, she told me I’m “not fit for the role.”\n\nThen she asked how I am and if I’m married. I told her I’m single, and she replied sarcastically, “Oh, you’re 35 and still single?” I didn’t even know how to respond. After that, she asked if I would prefer a rank-and-file job, which honestly felt like a slap in the face.\n\nIt hurts even more because yesterday was my birthday. I really hoped I’d receive good news or at least be treated with respect. Instead, I ended up crying. I haven’t had work since May. I’ve sent hundreds of applications, gone to only a few interviews, and sometimes reached final interviews but still no offer. I feel so hopeless, especially because I have no savings left and I don’t know how I’ll pay my bills for the next months. I’m also really sad and disappointed in myself, especially for my parents.",

I cannot give a single fuck I can’t even pretend to like it there anymore and I’m afraid it’s showing. I’m trying to find another job somewhere before they fire me for slacking but the hunt is slow going. I fell slightly guilty for barely trying but I have $0 in my bank account at the end of each month with what they are paying me and it’s built bitter resentment towards the whole fucking place. Plus they cut the (usually) 8% holiday bonuses completely \n\nMerry fucking Christmas",

    "text": "Struggling to work under an authoritarian leader **For context:**  \nI’ve been with a global employer for over a decade, across multiple roles and international locations. I’m a high performer and have strong relationships across the company. I recently moved into a new role, and my current leader joined about a month after I did. They moved from managing junior managers to our team now who are senior and seasoned manager. I’m trying to understand how to work with this leader, but several patterns are becoming difficult to manage.\n\nHere are a few characteristics I’m struggling with:\n\n**1. Leadership style: Authoritarian**\n\nEverything is a sprint — there’s no pause, no space, no reflection. Just constant pressure.\n\n**2. Controlling the narrative**\n\nWe have weekly meetings with our VP to share updates, learnings, and next steps as a team.  \nAfter one of the meetings, I was told that I shouldn’t share “unimportant input” with the VP because it undermines my leader — those were the exact words.\n\nThere had never been any guidance about what is or isn’t appropriate to share. I was then told to pre-share bullet points for approval. I responded that this crosses into micromanagement.\n\n**3. Lack of communication**\n\nMy leader frequently doesn’t share updates or discussions that happen between senior leaders or between our client’s senior leadership and ours, even when they directly relate to my account.\n\nDespite not being informed, I’m still expected to be fully up to speed. I’ve given feedback about this twice, but nothing has changed.\n\n**4. Deck perfectionism**\n\nI’m strong at building slides. My leader’s style is to tear them apart over formatting: millimeter spacing, alignment, extremely granular adjustments that aren’t noticeable to the end user.  \nIt feels petty and demotivating.\n\n**5. Lack of emotional intelligence**\n\nThis person is very mechanical and transactional. I’ve tried to build rapport beyond the day-to-day tasks, but there’s no interest in me as a human being.\n\nFor example: I shared that my partner was made redundant and how stressful things have been at home. There was no response, empathy, or follow-up.  \nYet when a family member on their side had an accident, my leader immediately cancelled our 1:1. I reached out the next morning to check in — because that’s how I operate — but the lack of reciprocity is difficult.\n\nThese things might sound small to some, but I thrive on relationships and psychological safety. I grow when there’s harmony and trust. I genuinely enjoy the role and am learning a lot, but working under this leader has become toxic for me. I feel burnt out, dread going into the office, and have started developing migraines and sleep issues from the stress.\n\nI’ve considered having a skip-level conversation with our VP (my leader’s manager), but I’m unsure how to approach it without sounding immature or simply being told to “talk to them again.” I’ve already tried that.\n\n**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with similar leaders.**\n\n* How did you cope while still performing?\n* Did you escalate or quietly plan your exit?\n* How do you manage someone who lacks emotional intelligence but holds power over your work?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot right now.",

I didn't know what Starbies or the system my other part time job uses, and I had to take them cause of a lack of a full-time job to survive.\n\nI'm pretty sure newbies at Mickey D's or Taco Bell didn't know the systems.

I did full-time customer service work and part-time in another language, and I picked whatever worked best for me to get ahead and survive.\n\nIf your position is entry, truly entry, why not put candidates like that into consideration?\n\nI was encouraged by friends to lie about my experience \"since they train you anyways\". \nBut that is a waste in some ways. You then get a dishonest candidate. Who still needs to be trained either way and waste more time because they may lose their cool now they got caught.\n\nIt's so frustrating. \n\nI interviewed for a leasing company and for a credit union this week. I hope I get the leasing company but in the second interview you could tell the person wasn't happy I didn't know the system, although I was clear with it from the first interview.

Nothing is heavy and the warehouse is quiet. I think I like it, but... Day 2, Asst. Mng.: \"Can the new girl even fuckin' count?!\" I immediately thought I messed up. I didn't. \n\n\nThen, the main manager goes on vacay for a month...two weeks after hiring me. (Totaling 32 hours over two weeks on the clock.) While he was away, apparently, everyone called out every other day. I was too new to notice who was or wasn't there. But, I did notice the lack of people to ask additional training questions. \n\n\nI had an immediate family member pass away in early Nov. I took two days. Work that I did on the day I returned was a little botched. A little botched as in, \"hit undo; save; fixed\" ...\n\n\nAn hour and half of the Asst. Mng. texting me, while off the clock, in slack asking where I placed 8 items...which he misplaced.\n\n\nI want to stay focused on personal interactions, per my therapist, but...  There's a man who is clearly (idk the pc) diminished in physical and intellectual abilities. \"Special\" or \"slow\" if you were raised in the 80s. Nice guy, names and handshakes like any other new coworker. I hear the Asst. Mng. *Screaming* at the main manager, while standing right next to the guy, \"He's *too* *slow*! He *can't* learn!\" It was one of the most distasteful experiences of my life. Pretty sure I witnessed some illegal shit there, as well. (Hostile workplace, protected class, aclu, all that...)\nBut, ultimately, unfortunately, that's 'not my business'. \n\n\nNext up was hours cut from 25 back to 16 because I'm \"too slow\" in Excel. With no metrics of \"slow\". \n\n\nNow, I'm accused of deleting full columns of excel sheets. Even though it was the asst. mng. who last edited it. Curious. The main manager suggested checking the cameras. Yes! Surveillance on who was sitting at the desk for an Excel sheet. \n\nI almost walked out. The main manger stopped me. I took five, came back in, and said let's try again. He seemed ok with it. We walked back in together. A different employee shouted through the warehouse a very sarcastic, accusatory statement at the manager that was clearly meant for me.\n\nSo, outbursts of shouting, texting off the clock, and berating a challenged man are grounds to peace the fuck out, right? \n\nPlease and thank you! \nShaky hands, please disregard typos.",

    "text": "Antiwork rant, this can’t be it I’m just posting to scream into the void. I work in the US nonprofit field and I am exhausted. I left my last job because it had an extremely toxic work environment where me and my colleagues were constantly being harassed by management. I changed jobs and I’m still in a situation where I have to basically fight to do my actual work. The work alone should be hard enough, but I can’t even really engage with the work itself because the environment is so suffocating. And I know in a lot of ways, I’m one of the lucky ones - salaried hybrid office job with minimal oversight. But it feels like these jobs are killing me from the inside out. \n\nThis can’t be it. The idea of having to ask permission to take time off or take care of a loved one or be a fucking human for the next 3 decades of my life feels insurmountable. We are forced to give jobs our youth, our energy, our bodies. And if we are lucky to live long enough and save enough money, then we can retire - when most of us are tired and burnt out and have lost interest in things that used to excite us. For people who are able to reach retirement and enjoy it, I am so happy for you because we all deserve that. But there are a lot of technically retired people that are suffering for a myriad of other reasons that stem from no longer working. \n\nAnd the double speak in these workplaces makes me want to rip my hair out. Some people, especially in management, really like to pretend that we don’t exist outside of our jobs, that things outside of work don’t affect our days, that the workplace is free from all the ducked up -isms that plague society. Like they will completely ignore the elephant in the room and pretend it just doesn’t exist when you bring it up. It honestly makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s like we aren’t speaking the same language or existing in the same reality. I can’t begin to imagine the psychological and societal damages this causes to people who go to work every day and just lie through their teeth and/or let horrible things happen in front of them over and over again on a daily basis. We are not well. \n\nI am exhausted and I am sad and I have so many working years ahead of me. And I hate how we are made to feel guilty about hating this because so many people don’t have access to work and are hardly surviving because of it. Like I should just suck it up cause at least I have some health insurance and can afford rent and food, at least for now. \n\nThis can’t be it. I want more for all of us. I want us all to be able to enjoy our lives fully, not just to spend our lives working to survive. I know I’m not the first or the last person to say this, but I’m just feeling particularly depressed about it all lately. End of rant, back to work.",

I do have several chronic medical conditions I am taking medication for and I see my doctor regularly. I used to work in nursing homes but the physical nature of the work in the long term care setting  became too much for me so I opted to work in home health as it is less physically strenuous. \n\nI had been having pain in my left leg which I thought was  arthritis so I rubbed my leg down with pain relieving cream and continued to work. \n\nRecently I signed up with a home health agency that had a super strict attendance policy. On Tuesday my leg seemed a little swollen but I knew I could not \n call off. I could barely put weight on my left foot but managed to get to my clients house and start my shift. \n\nDuring the shift my foot and leg became so swollen and painful I couldn't keep my shoe on. I called my family doctor who advised me to go to the emergency room immediately. I stayed at work till about 30 minutes before my shift ended. The swelling and pain was so bad that I could barely make it to my car and my clients son had to help me. I drive immediately to the emergency room and they came out with a wheelchair to wheel me inside. Turns out that my knee and foot are severely inflamed from an acute osteoarthritis flare up (no broken bones or blood clots) and I need to be off my leg for several days, take prescription NSAIDS, and elevate my foot. The er doctor excused me from work for 2 days, and instructed me to follow up with my regular doctor. \n\nYesterday I followed up with my regular doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me another week off work for the pain and swelling to subside. He gave me another Dr Excuse and accompanying medical documentation. I took it to the home health agency office. \n\nThey are upset because I had a medical issue at a clients home and that  it did not resolve itself in 24 hours. I'm doing better and instead of not being able to walk now I'm walking slowly with a cane. In 4-5 days I should be able to return to work, although it will be awhile until I'm 100 percent. \n\nThe agency I work for has disabled my access to the app we use to sign in and out of shifts or see extra shifts.  I found this out last night .\n\nI'm at the agency office waiting to speak to the branch mgr to find out if I'm fired or not so I can pursue other jobs while I'm off. I do need the job and can use the money but even if they do agree to put me back on the schedule I'll be looking for other work. I don't like the attitude. Like I did this to myself on purpose. \n\nLesson learned--instead of listening to employers that tell me to work through illness --like when I first had pain--should have seen my doctor right away and could have possibly avoided this flare up to begin with.",

    "text": "The hardest part of my job isn’t the work, it’s the constant urgency over nothing What’s been wearing me down lately isn’t workload or long hours, it’s how everything at my job is treated like an emergency. Emails marked urgent that aren’t. Meetings called last minute that could’ve been a message. Deadlines that suddenly can’t move even though they magically do a week later.\n\nIt creates this background anxiety where you’re always bracing for something, even on normal days. You can’t fully relax because you’re waiting for the next ping that’s going to demand immediate attention for no real reason. I’ve noticed it follows me home too I’ll be off the clock but still feel tense, like I forgot something important.\n\nThe strange thing is, I recently realized I have some money saved up enough that I’m not in immediate danger if things go sideways and instead of feeling relieved it made me more aware of how unnecessary the stress culture is. The job isn’t saving lives. The urgency is mostly manufactured and yet it takes up so much mental space. I don’t hate working. I just hate working in an environment where panic is treated like productivity. I wish more workplaces understood that constant pressure doesn’t make people perform better it just makes them exhausted.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the fake urgency is more draining than the actual work itself?",

He wants to buy an unreasonable amount of new licenses for a tool that the current licensees don't even use. \n\nThe vendor emailed a quote this week, and as expected it was exorbitant.

In the \"spirit of partnership\" with the vendor, he offered ME to fly across the planet and deliver a keynote speech at their client event. \n\nDidn't ask me. Didn't consider that I don't do speaking engagements (and I never will). Just offered me and my time against my will. He then went on to BRAG about it in his next meeting, which I wasn't even part of. My colleagues came out of the meeting asking me about my speaking engagement and my boss still hadn't even talked with me about it. \n\nI'm in such disbelief. Maybe I'm overreacting a little, but it felt dehumanizing to be used as a bargaining chip without my knowledge.

We shouldn’t be working this much, and it’s literally killing us In my corporation there are a lot of people who are noticeably overweight, especially higher ups.

Curious, I reached out to HR as to why this happened and I received a new PTO/holiday policy enacted in Jan 2025.\n\nThe new policy states that they don’t provide holiday/vacation hours until after the employee has worked one continuous year, and because I had a break in between longer than 45 days my previous time here means diddly poo. \n\nThis is the fun part, I asked \\*what\\* the reasoning for this new policy was and HR slave said she didn’t know, only that it was voted on by the executives. The six of them, in a room, taking away holidays and vacations but will never miss an opportunity pat themselves on the back reiterating what a “great company environment” they’re creating.\n\nYou know what?! I would’ve preferred the opposite. At least be honest that you took away a chunk of my paycheck to help fuel your ego. Fucking spineless bastards. \n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant, hope everyone has a better holiday than me!",

    "text": "Is it weird my coworkers completely ignored a shoutout my boss gave me? It actually kinda hurt. So this might sound small, but it honestly bothered me more than I expected.\n\nYesterday, my boss shouted me out in our team group chat. It was really positive and specific praise about a project I worked hard on. She tagged me directly, and it was clear she put effort into acknowledging the work.\n\nOur team is very small, and usually when anyone gets a kudos or shoutout, the whole group reacts - hearts, congrats, emojis, all of that. I’m always one of the first people to hype others up, because that’s just how I am. I always like/react, congratulate, and show appreciation when people get recognized.\n\nBut when it was my turn?\n\nLiterally no one reacted.\n\nNot a single emoji except for one coworker (the only one I genuinely vibe with). Everyone else was online, saw it, and just… ignored it. Meanwhile, if you scroll up in the chat, everyone reacted to all the other shoutouts for other people.\n\nIt made me feel excluded and honestly embarrassed. Like everyone celebrated each other except me.\n\nFor context, I’m also the only Black person on the team. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but it does add another layer because I work extra hard to be approachable, warm, positive, and “easy” to work with - just so no one can twist my attitude or energy into a stereotype. I show up for people, I support them, and I genuinely try to keep the workplace vibe positive.\n\nSo yeah, it stung when nobody could give something as simple as a heart reaction back.\n\nI’m not saying they need to validate my work - my boss’s praise is ultimately what matters. But the contrast was loud. And it lowkey made me feel singled out or excluded.\n\nAt this point I’m thinking of pulling my energy back. No more overcompensating, no extra warmth, no small talk. I’ll be professional, get my work done, and that’s it. The only people I’m giving extra grace to are my boss and the one coworker who actually acknowledged me.\n\nMaybe I’m too sensitive, maybe it means nothing - but it honestly didn’t feel good.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\n\nIs this normal team behavior, or is it a red flag?",

Instead, after those two questions, she told me I’m “not fit for the role.”\n\nThen she asked how I am and if I’m married. I told her I’m single, and she replied sarcastically, “Oh, you’re 35 and still single?” I didn’t even know how to respond. After that, she asked if I would prefer a rank-and-file job, which honestly felt like a slap in the face.\n\nIt hurts even more because yesterday was my birthday. I really hoped I’d receive good news or at least be treated with respect. Instead, I ended up crying. I haven’t had work since May. I’ve sent hundreds of applications, gone to only a few interviews, and sometimes reached final interviews but still no offer. I feel so hopeless, especially because I have no savings left and I don’t know how I’ll pay my bills for the next months. I’m also really sad and disappointed in myself, especially for my parents.",

Trust me, narcissistic bosses are everywhere you go I work at a mental health clinic, surrounded by psychologists, therapists, and people who constantly talk about empathy, communication, and mental wellness. You’d think this would be the one place where leadership actually models those values.\n\nBut my boss? She doesn’t even have a psychology background (just a business degree) and it really shows. She talks to us like we’re children, makes us feel stupid for asking normal questions, and every interaction has an accusatory, condescending tone. It’s honestly embarrassing that someone leading a mental health clinic can be so unaware of the impact she has on her staff.\n\nI’m an administrative staff member with a really critical role in this clinic, and my mental health has taken such a hit because of her. My confidence and self-esteem have tanked to the point where I wake up dreading work so intensely that I find myself wishing something would stop me from having to go in. It’s gotten to a level that doesn’t feel normal or healthy.\n\nJust needed to vent because it blows my mind that even in a place built around mental health, narcissistic bosses still thrive. If anyone else has been through this, I’d love to hear how you handled it- it’s been really tough.\n\nEDIT: our company is small and therefore have no HR department. SHE is HR. Lol",

You then get a dishonest candidate. Who still needs to be trained either way and waste more time because they may lose their cool now they got caught.\n\nIt's so frustrating. \n\nI interviewed for a leasing company and for a credit union this week.

    "text": "Antiwork rant, this can’t be it I’m just posting to scream into the void. I work in the US nonprofit field and I am exhausted. I left my last job because it had an extremely toxic work environment where me and my colleagues were constantly being harassed by management. I changed jobs and I’m still in a situation where I have to basically fight to do my actual work. The work alone should be hard enough, but I can’t even really engage with the work itself because the environment is so suffocating. And I know in a lot of ways, I’m one of the lucky ones - salaried hybrid office job with minimal oversight. But it feels like these jobs are killing me from the inside out. \n\nThis can’t be it. The idea of having to ask permission to take time off or take care of a loved one or be a fucking human for the next 3 decades of my life feels insurmountable. We are forced to give jobs our youth, our energy, our bodies. And if we are lucky to live long enough and save enough money, then we can retire - when most of us are tired and burnt out and have lost interest in things that used to excite us. For people who are able to reach retirement and enjoy it, I am so happy for you because we all deserve that. But there are a lot of technically retired people that are suffering for a myriad of other reasons that stem from no longer working. \n\nAnd the double speak in these workplaces makes me want to rip my hair out. Some people, especially in management, really like to pretend that we don’t exist outside of our jobs, that things outside of work don’t affect our days, that the workplace is free from all the ducked up -isms that plague society. Like they will completely ignore the elephant in the room and pretend it just doesn’t exist when you bring it up. It honestly makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s like we aren’t speaking the same language or existing in the same reality. I can’t begin to imagine the psychological and societal damages this causes to people who go to work every day and just lie through their teeth and/or let horrible things happen in front of them over and over again on a daily basis. We are not well. \n\nI am exhausted and I am sad and I have so many working years ahead of me. And I hate how we are made to feel guilty about hating this because so many people don’t have access to work and are hardly surviving because of it. Like I should just suck it up cause at least I have some health insurance and can afford rent and food, at least for now. \n\nThis can’t be it. I want more for all of us. I want us all to be able to enjoy our lives fully, not just to spend our lives working to survive. I know I’m not the first or the last person to say this, but I’m just feeling particularly depressed about it all lately. End of rant, back to work.",

This store alone has 50+ divided into 3 shifts “teams.” Most of my team gets it. We’re civil to each other but aren’t there to make friends. Only like 1 or 2 people are bootlickers “um it’s actually against company policy 🤓”-types and the rest of us actively avoid being paired with them. The problem for me is when the morning shift team arrives and I still have an hour left to work. They always wanna smile and ask how I’m doing and what not. I honestly ignore them so that maybe they’d get the hint, but they still try to talk to me after nearly a year with the company. Most of them are older 50’s+. Last week I was stocking like prepackaged meats, and this woman working online orders tried to tell me that some of the bacon had gone bad. I just looked at her with a deadpan expression. She lifted it up and was, “ew, this is yucky” and I wanted to tell her “yeah capitalism is gross tf you want me to do about it?”. She then goes to a coworker of hers and has them take it to waste/claims. I was so annoyed by that cause 1) the company doesn’t care 2) she isn’t my boss 3) I usually have time to do that type of stuff (cleaning/organizing) after I’m done with the freight I have to stock. It’s like a second priority if I have the time and usually do. Also, she could have taken it herself. My store is one of the better ones in the area and I’m usually in frozen where there’s mold in the back of the fridges. Trust me lady, corporate doesn’t care about the communities they serve and they certainly don’t care you’re doing your best. \n\nWhew.

We shouldn’t be working this much, and it’s literally killing us In my corporation there are a lot of people who are noticeably overweight, especially higher ups.

Between work and other life responsibilities, minimal time is left to get sufficient exercise and cook healthy meals.\n\nPeople love to knock the fast food industry and Americans’ bad choices, but the reality is that we’re usually at work so we can afford to stay alive, and we don’t have time to do things that would be very good for our health.

    "text": "Medical Emergency at Work Just venting here and maybe seeking advice. I'm not sure. \n\nI'm a 48 yo home health aide. I do have several chronic medical conditions I am taking medication for and I see my doctor regularly. I used to work in nursing homes but the physical nature of the work in the long term care setting  became too much for me so I opted to work in home health as it is less physically strenuous. \n\nI had been having pain in my left leg which I thought was  arthritis so I rubbed my leg down with pain relieving cream and continued to work. \n\nRecently I signed up with a home health agency that had a super strict attendance policy. On Tuesday my leg seemed a little swollen but I knew I could not \n call off. I could barely put weight on my left foot but managed to get to my clients house and start my shift. \n\nDuring the shift my foot and leg became so swollen and painful I couldn't keep my shoe on. I called my family doctor who advised me to go to the emergency room immediately. I stayed at work till about 30 minutes before my shift ended. The swelling and pain was so bad that I could barely make it to my car and my clients son had to help me. I drive immediately to the emergency room and they came out with a wheelchair to wheel me inside. Turns out that my knee and foot are severely inflamed from an acute osteoarthritis flare up (no broken bones or blood clots) and I need to be off my leg for several days, take prescription NSAIDS, and elevate my foot. The er doctor excused me from work for 2 days, and instructed me to follow up with my regular doctor. \n\nYesterday I followed up with my regular doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me another week off work for the pain and swelling to subside. He gave me another Dr Excuse and accompanying medical documentation. I took it to the home health agency office. \n\nThey are upset because I had a medical issue at a clients home and that  it did not resolve itself in 24 hours. I'm doing better and instead of not being able to walk now I'm walking slowly with a cane. In 4-5 days I should be able to return to work, although it will be awhile until I'm 100 percent. \n\nThe agency I work for has disabled my access to the app we use to sign in and out of shifts or see extra shifts.  I found this out last night .\n\nI'm at the agency office waiting to speak to the branch mgr to find out if I'm fired or not so I can pursue other jobs while I'm off. I do need the job and can use the money but even if they do agree to put me back on the schedule I'll be looking for other work. I don't like the attitude. Like I did this to myself on purpose. \n\nLesson learned--instead of listening to employers that tell me to work through illness --like when I first had pain--should have seen my doctor right away and could have possibly avoided this flare up to begin with.",

Emails marked urgent that aren’t. Meetings called last minute that could’ve been a message. Deadlines that suddenly can’t move even though they magically do a week later.\n\nIt creates this background anxiety where you’re always bracing for something, even on normal days. You can’t fully relax because you’re waiting for the next ping that’s going to demand immediate attention for no real reason. I’ve noticed it follows me home too I’ll be off the clock but still feel tense, like I forgot something important.\n\nThe strange thing is, I recently realized I have some money saved up enough that I’m not in immediate danger if things go sideways and instead of feeling relieved it made me more aware of how unnecessary the stress culture is. The job isn’t saving lives. The urgency is mostly manufactured and yet it takes up so much mental space. I don’t hate working. I just hate working in an environment where panic is treated like productivity. I wish more workplaces understood that constant pressure doesn’t make people perform better it just makes them exhausted.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the fake urgency is more draining than the actual work itself?",

I left my last job because it had an extremely toxic work environment where me and my colleagues were constantly being harassed by management. I changed jobs and I’m still in a situation where I have to basically fight to do my actual work. The work alone should be hard enough, but I can’t even really engage with the work itself because the environment is so suffocating. And I know in a lot of ways, I’m one of the lucky ones - salaried hybrid office job with minimal oversight. But it feels like these jobs are killing me from the inside out. \n\nThis can’t be it. The idea of having to ask permission to take time off or take care of a loved one or be a fucking human for the next 3 decades of my life feels insurmountable. We are forced to give jobs our youth, our energy, our bodies. And if we are lucky to live long enough and save enough money, then we can retire - when most of us are tired and burnt out and have lost interest in things that used to excite us. For people who are able to reach retirement and enjoy it, I am so happy for you because we all deserve that. But there are a lot of technically retired people that are suffering for a myriad of other reasons that stem from no longer working. \n\nAnd the double speak in these workplaces makes me want to rip my hair out. Some people, especially in management, really like to pretend that we don’t exist outside of our jobs, that things outside of work don’t affect our days, that the workplace is free from all the ducked up -isms that plague society. Like they will completely ignore the elephant in the room and pretend it just doesn’t exist when you bring it up. It honestly makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s like we aren’t speaking the same language or existing in the same reality. I can’t begin to imagine the psychological and societal damages this causes to people who go to work every day and just lie through their teeth and/or let horrible things happen in front of them over and over again on a daily basis. We are not well. \n\nI am exhausted and I am sad and I have so many working years ahead of me. And I hate how we are made to feel guilty about hating this because so many people don’t have access to work and are hardly surviving because of it. Like I should just suck it up cause at least I have some health insurance and can afford rent and food, at least for now. \n\nThis can’t be it. I want more for all of us. I want us all to be able to enjoy our lives fully, not just to spend our lives working to survive. I know I’m not the first or the last person to say this, but I’m just feeling particularly depressed about it all lately. End of rant, back to work.",

    "text": "Cried on my birthday after getting rejected in the final interview. I had my final interview yesterday with the Department Head, and it honestly left me devastated. She only asked me two questions: why I took Psychology and what the most difficult challenge I’ve encountered is. I answered both questions fully and honestly, but that was it.\n\nFor context, I’ve been in leadership roles for almost 10 years. I came prepared to talk about my skills, my experience, and how I can contribute to the team. Instead, after those two questions, she told me I’m “not fit for the role.”\n\nThen she asked how I am and if I’m married. I told her I’m single, and she replied sarcastically, “Oh, you’re 35 and still single?” I didn’t even know how to respond. After that, she asked if I would prefer a rank-and-file job, which honestly felt like a slap in the face.\n\nIt hurts even more because yesterday was my birthday. I really hoped I’d receive good news or at least be treated with respect. Instead, I ended up crying. I haven’t had work since May. I’ve sent hundreds of applications, gone to only a few interviews, and sometimes reached final interviews but still no offer. I feel so hopeless, especially because I have no savings left and I don’t know how I’ll pay my bills for the next months. I’m also really sad and disappointed in myself, especially for my parents.",

    "text": "Is it weird my coworkers completely ignored a shoutout my boss gave me? It actually kinda hurt. So this might sound small, but it honestly bothered me more than I expected.\n\nYesterday, my boss shouted me out in our team group chat. It was really positive and specific praise about a project I worked hard on. She tagged me directly, and it was clear she put effort into acknowledging the work.\n\nOur team is very small, and usually when anyone gets a kudos or shoutout, the whole group reacts - hearts, congrats, emojis, all of that. I’m always one of the first people to hype others up, because that’s just how I am. I always like/react, congratulate, and show appreciation when people get recognized.\n\nBut when it was my turn?\n\nLiterally no one reacted.\n\nNot a single emoji except for one coworker (the only one I genuinely vibe with). Everyone else was online, saw it, and just… ignored it. Meanwhile, if you scroll up in the chat, everyone reacted to all the other shoutouts for other people.\n\nIt made me feel excluded and honestly embarrassed. Like everyone celebrated each other except me.\n\nFor context, I’m also the only Black person on the team. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but it does add another layer because I work extra hard to be approachable, warm, positive, and “easy” to work with - just so no one can twist my attitude or energy into a stereotype. I show up for people, I support them, and I genuinely try to keep the workplace vibe positive.\n\nSo yeah, it stung when nobody could give something as simple as a heart reaction back.\n\nI’m not saying they need to validate my work - my boss’s praise is ultimately what matters. But the contrast was loud. And it lowkey made me feel singled out or excluded.\n\nAt this point I’m thinking of pulling my energy back. No more overcompensating, no extra warmth, no small talk. I’ll be professional, get my work done, and that’s it. The only people I’m giving extra grace to are my boss and the one coworker who actually acknowledged me.\n\nMaybe I’m too sensitive, maybe it means nothing - but it honestly didn’t feel good.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\n\nIs this normal team behavior, or is it a red flag?",

    "text": "The day the decrement operator ran The words were direct: \"Due to a change in business requirements, your role has become redundant. Your services are no longer required, and your employment will end on \\[XYZ date\\].\" The time froze on the employee's clock.\n\nIt was the standard corporate script, delivered to a speechless employee, confirming the final fear. It proved the undeniable truth: the employee was simply a headcount. On that day, the system executed the decrement operator, --1, several thousands of times on the employee database.\n\nYears of proven track record were overshadowed by a shift in technology. If technology, which constantly receives updates, can become redundant, why should employees be any different? Employees are not products; they are bound to be discarded.\n\nThe capitalistic world celebrated their new billionaires (and soon, trillionaires), they never become redundant. The employee, however, remains a mere spectator to the drama.\n\nEmployees are told to rinse and repeat, and grind for 27 hours a day, but those 27 hours are insufficient. They must constantly upskill, unlearn, and relearn just to live. The law of \"survival of the fittest,\" a concept of nature, now turns against the very humans who built the technology. Humans have to survive against technology.\n\nThe cycle will continue: new people will work, new tech will emerge, and the next wave of us will be told to eat, sleep, work, and repeat—until the decrement operator runs again.\n\nHistory does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.

    "text": "Struggling to work under an authoritarian leader **For context:**  \nI’ve been with a global employer for over a decade, across multiple roles and international locations. I’m a high performer and have strong relationships across the company. I recently moved into a new role, and my current leader joined about a month after I did. They moved from managing junior managers to our team now who are senior and seasoned manager. I’m trying to understand how to work with this leader, but several patterns are becoming difficult to manage.\n\nHere are a few characteristics I’m struggling with:\n\n**1. Leadership style: Authoritarian**\n\nEverything is a sprint — there’s no pause, no space, no reflection. Just constant pressure.\n\n**2. Controlling the narrative**\n\nWe have weekly meetings with our VP to share updates, learnings, and next steps as a team.  \nAfter one of the meetings, I was told that I shouldn’t share “unimportant input” with the VP because it undermines my leader — those were the exact words.\n\nThere had never been any guidance about what is or isn’t appropriate to share. I was then told to pre-share bullet points for approval. I responded that this crosses into micromanagement.\n\n**3. Lack of communication**\n\nMy leader frequently doesn’t share updates or discussions that happen between senior leaders or between our client’s senior leadership and ours, even when they directly relate to my account.\n\nDespite not being informed, I’m still expected to be fully up to speed. I’ve given feedback about this twice, but nothing has changed.\n\n**4. Deck perfectionism**\n\nI’m strong at building slides. My leader’s style is to tear them apart over formatting: millimeter spacing, alignment, extremely granular adjustments that aren’t noticeable to the end user.  \nIt feels petty and demotivating.\n\n**5. Lack of emotional intelligence**\n\nThis person is very mechanical and transactional. I’ve tried to build rapport beyond the day-to-day tasks, but there’s no interest in me as a human being.\n\nFor example: I shared that my partner was made redundant and how stressful things have been at home. There was no response, empathy, or follow-up.  \nYet when a family member on their side had an accident, my leader immediately cancelled our 1:1. I reached out the next morning to check in — because that’s how I operate — but the lack of reciprocity is difficult.\n\nThese things might sound small to some, but I thrive on relationships and psychological safety. I grow when there’s harmony and trust. I genuinely enjoy the role and am learning a lot, but working under this leader has become toxic for me. I feel burnt out, dread going into the office, and have started developing migraines and sleep issues from the stress.\n\nI’ve considered having a skip-level conversation with our VP (my leader’s manager), but I’m unsure how to approach it without sounding immature or simply being told to “talk to them again.” I’ve already tried that.\n\n**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with similar leaders.**\n\n* How did you cope while still performing?\n* Did you escalate or quietly plan your exit?\n* How do you manage someone who lacks emotional intelligence but holds power over your work?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot right now.",

I can't find this discussed anywhere on the internet, so I've been wondering if there are two Pokemon that share a single type, whilst being dual type, and having different weaknesses. So lets say you got a flying fire pokemon and a flying rock type.\n\nI know they share weaknesses, and flying rock actually has more weaknesses, but imagine in another universe where that wasn't the case, and the typings actually cancelled eachother out, making it so that when fire and flying is paired together, it has completely or almost completely different weakness than rock flying.\n\nSo are there any real examples of that which exist? The main reason I ask is because sometimes when team building, I want to use 2 pokemon that share a type, but I don't use more than one type for coverage. If it was the case where they shared a type but due to their secondary typing, the weaknesses were different, I would love to use both those pokemon. Also it's an interesting question. Also it doesn't have to be the same primary type, it can also be the secondary type, as long as they share a type, with another type being different.",

    "text": "New Mega Ability Idea!!! [(Spoilers if you haven’t seen the new megas!!!)]\n\n______________________________________\n\nSo glad Golisopod got a mega!!! Such a cool mon deserves more love. But we all know, some pocket-monsters live or die, by their abilities. We won’t know what the new abilities are for a while, so let’s speculate!\n\nFor Mega G-pod, I think I’d be cool if the new ability was a different spin on its signature ability: Emergency Exit.\n\nOf course, EE makes him obtuse to use at times, but I think it’d be sweet if the mega gets an ability that does the opposite!\n\nThe Red Card held item forces the opponent to switch out after attacking the holder. Similarly, moves like Circle Throw and Dragon Tail force a random switch out via an attack (at the cost of decreased priority). What if this new ability could do something similar?\n______________________________________\n\nHere’s my pitch:\n\nAbility: Ruthless Removal \n“If the user hits the opponent with an attack and the opponent survives with &gt; 50% Hp, the opponent is forced to switch out.”\n\nNotes:\n\n- Still working on a good ability name, idk if RR sounds cool? ‘You’d Better Run’ is my runner up- which, admittedly, is WAY funnier lol\n\n- This alone might be too powerful on such a defensive mon? With its monumentally improved defenses (Def: 175 &amp; Sp.D: 120), it might be too easy to juggle an enemy team?\n\n- Alternatively, the ability could be a more of a‘compound ability’, like a certain sparky dragon we know (Miraidon, it’s Miraidon). \n\nIn that case, the ability could ‘reduce the priority of the user’s attacks’. Think like an offensive version of Toedscruel’s Mycelium Might.\n\nIn exchange for all attacks being last in their individual priority bracket (so First Impression is still functional), any attack that hits the opponent, forces them to switch with a random party member.\n______________________________________\n\nOur boy G-pod has suffered enough from his bad tendencies to cut &amp; run!!

OGD, Victini, and even Genesect are pokemon that to be revisited in a meaningful other than just being cameos in other generation's games!! Like OGD, Victini, and even Genesect are pokemon that just begging to be revisited in a meaningful other than just being cameos in other generation's games!\n\nOGD makes the most sense, given how it's the unique case of a legendary pokemon, technically being three pokemon into one. Seem the most logical to finally answer that.\n\nVictini could be the typical, adorable legendary pokemon that follows around in the early game only to have a sick final boss battle, where it unveils a new form or something with the power of friendship (cliche, I know...).\n\nGenesect could be the perfect mon to debut with team plasma's return since the events of BW1, we know that they have been directly involved with its creation! However, N put it onto hold since he believed that all pokemon are perfect and don't need to altered.\n\nThe only way you could get genesect and get it's lore was having a mystery gift (a sorta non canon) thing, most of the time at-least.\n\nGenesect being their final stand mon, would be a poetic swan song and show pathetic they have become but would at-least show they are very much still evil. Having Ghetsis (or standing his beliefs) evil belief that pokemon are to be used only as tools!\n\nAnd naturally, the player has to prove them wrong and save the suffering bug-steel mon.",

    "text": "Do you think we will get a second dlc for legends za or mega dimension part 2? With the dlc out now, it feels incomplete and rushed. It makes me thing we could get a part 2 of some sort. And no the post game of the dlc doesn’t count but it does hint more could be coming. I do think if they make a part 2 it must be perfect and not rushed. It should also be less grindy (including the main game) and more story based. Include new legendaries, forms, and villains. Have Volo return and maybe this mayor that Mable hates as villains. Bring back the rest of the Team Flare admins and let us go outside lumoise. If it’s a part 2 to mega dimension, perhaps show who made darkrai go through that since it wasn’t evil but used by some other higher Pokemon. Bring an actual A legendary for ZA which is chaotic and truly evil like Eternatus is.\n\nThe one key detail is that Pokemon has not announced a physical base game + dlc for the switch version and switch 2 edition yet like they always do since SWSH. And keep in mind they announce it when the final dlc for Swsh and sv was announced or was still in development meaning it may not be over and perhaps Pokemon day could announce a final part and the physical rereleases. Speaking of Pokemon day, the placeholder date was February 28, 2026. So could it be that they will release something to celebrate Pokémon’s 30th anniversary with legends ZA while they work on gen 10 for later next year or perhaps 2027?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Pokemon home is not compatible with the game yet and that usually means they’re saving it for dlc but since mega dimension is out it’s not even compatible yet.\n\nEdit 2: also take a look at this\n\n[https://x.com/ama\\_shinu/status/1965772165225308523?s=46](https://x.com/ama_shinu/status/1965772165225308523?s=46)\n\nIt’s been leaked by Khu if you keep looking which he got right we would get dlc so there is a chance for a second one\n\nBut what do you all think? A part 2 for mega dimension, a second separate dlc which may not correlate to mega dimension, physical rereleases with base game plus dlc for both switch and switch 2, or no second dlc?",

There is not any in-universe interregional consensus nor any agreed standard whatsoever for magnitudes and measurements. \"Very hot pokemon, this pokemon can emmit over one quintillion gazillion skibidillion volts and four hundred pokemillion grades farenheit\"\n\nMy headcanon is that the pokemon talked about in the dex do not, in fact, produce that much heat or electricity, but such numbers being featured may follow at least one of three possible explainations:\n\n\\-The pokemon investigators who wrote those entries faced serious budget limitations and/or overworking in their investigation. Bad instrumentals, no money, very little time, too much effort and too little help. Send some young trainers to catch interesting beasts, get them out of the box for a few minutes, note the obvious and then go onto the next. When fire types and electric types do crazy shit, do a vague estimation, write it down, and move on. \n\n\\-The pokedex is written for literal 10 year olds to read. When there are pokemon that are kinda dangerous to mess with, the proffesors throw a random big number like \"careful, this thing burns\". \n\n\\-In the pokemon universe, Farenheit and Celcius were ancient and famous fire type trainers. Same with Volta and Ampere for electrics, Kelvin with ice types and Ohm was the first legendary trainer to have been recorded to fight and tame Groudon. Their legends lived on, so in their regions, their names were used to name measurement units. However, turns out, there has not been made any agreement on an \"absolute system\" of units, which leads to various regions using, for exame, the same \"farenheit\" for temperature, but assigning it different values.",

(TLDR at the end)\n\nSo about 6 weeks ago I was hired on as a seasonal position at a very big warehouse store in my area that occasionally carries pokemon cards. \n\n3 days ago on Monday, i was helping folding clothing in the clothing department of the store where I overheard one of the overnight workers mention the newest sets of pokemon cards. Now, I usually keep to myself and avoid people at work but I'll take any chance to talk pokemon. \n\nSo I walk up to the guy and strike up a conversation about cards and what types we collect and as we're hitting it off the overnight manager walks over and asks \"Are yall walking about pokemon?\" Me and the coworker said yea and I was just about to ask if he also collected cards when he spoke up and asked \"So are yall scalpers?\" There was a brief pause of silence before me and the coworker erupted saying \"why would he say that\" and \"what the heck man?\"\nHe responded word for word: \"Cause I sell information about when we get cards to scalpers.\" With the smugest face imaginable. We asked what he mentioned and he said he sells them information on the exact day, time, what sets, and how many pokemon cards we get.\n\nMe and the coworker got very heated by that. We were saying \"how could you do that\" and that hes \"vile for doing such shit.\" He doubled down on it by saying he \"makes BANK\" doing it and that \"money is money.\" \n\nNow, the coworker gave up cause hes pretty buddy-buddy with that manager, I however, have been a major pokemon fan all my life and will take every chance to ruin a scalpers day and right before me was a person who feeds those parasites.\n\nSo I went and immediately reported him. I went to a manager who had a big jolteon and ash hat (kanto) pikachu tattoo and had to quickly explain since he was walking out the door when i saw him. The problem tho, the overnight manager has been with the company for 8 years, ive been there for 6 weeks. It'll be difficult to get them to believe my word over his...  or so I thought.\n\nI learned today that they immediately started an investigation into the guy and suspended him without pay until the investigation is completed, which I was so happy to hear. According to the good manager, he tried to play it off as \"just making conversation\" and \"playing a prank.\" (which is absolutely bs)\n\nI told them about the coworker with me and the exact date, time, and location it happened and ill tell them exactly in detail what went down next time I go in on Sunday. \n\nI despise pokemon card scalpers so to take down someone selling them information feels so rewarding.\n\nWill update when something happens.\n\nTLDR:\nThe overnight manager at my store admitted to selling information about the exact date and time of when we get pokemon cards in to scalpers and I reported him. He got suspended with no pay until the investigation is done.",

    "text": "(OC) I’m making all Gen 1 pokemons in human form. Here is Caterpie evolution line # Warlock - Pact of the Crisalis - Caterpie finds an Archfey Patron\n\nHello everyone! This week we finally finished the starters and ventured into the first bug type. I was thinking about concepts for this drawing in the past couple of weeks. At first I was torn between a Warlock with an Archfey as Patron and a Circle of the Spores druid. The big thing was how to make the transitions between the designs of Caterpie and Metapod to Butterfree. \n\nThe exoskeleton of insects kinda guides the mind to making things armor related, but I was having some trouble on making a timeline from an armored character to something totally different in the last stage. I’ve been trying to not fall into the trap of making knights all the time, because I really like drawing armor (maybe a theme just for knights in the future?).\n\nI decided to go with the Warlock idea and Caterpie started to become more of a tiny explorer that found an ancient butterfree stone, got trapped in a cocoon and went through a transformation pact to become Butterfree. This led to a second decision that I was delaying: should I make characters just in human form or should I start making different species? Since the main idea was the transformation it felt a bit weird to just make a change in clothes or tiny things like the color of the eyes. We ended up with this insect + human hybrid and I found it pretty fun to draw. This opens doors to more things like this in the future, so expect more elves, orcs and things like that.\n\n# Will Weddle have the same concept?\n\nAt the beginning yes, I would just change the patron and make something a bit more dark for Weddle. But I’m feeling more inclined to make a different story and go for a poison assassin story. Maybe they go through a long and ancient hibernation process that hardens their skin and opens a room to make the Kakuna design. \n\nI want to thank everyone that is giving amazing support so far. Weedle evolution line will probably be the last one of this year and after that we will take a break to prepare for next year. But we will probably be posting the Gijinkas that were commissioned in the last weeks of December, so you guys don’t have to wait a lot to see more Pokemon Gijinka art.\n\nWishing you all an amazing weekend!",

    "text": "(OC) I’m making all Gen 1 pokemons in human form. Here is Caterpie evolution line # Warlock - Pact of the Crisalis - Caterpie finds an Archfey Patron\n\nHello everyone! This week we finally finished the starters and ventured into the first bug type. I was thinking about concepts for this drawing in the past couple of weeks. At first I was torn between a Warlock with an Archfey as Patron and a Circle of the Spores druid. The big thing was how to make the transitions between the designs of Caterpie and Metapod to Butterfree. \n\nThe exoskeleton of insects kinda guides the mind to making things armor related, but I was having some trouble on making a timeline from an armored character to something totally different in the last stage. I’ve been trying to not fall into the trap of making knights all the time, because I really like drawing armor (maybe a theme just for knights in the future?).\n\nI decided to go with the Warlock idea and Caterpie started to become more of a tiny explorer that found an ancient butterfree stone, got trapped in a cocoon and went through a transformation pact to become Butterfree. This led to a second decision that I was delaying: should I make characters just in human form or should I start making different species? Since the main idea was the transformation it felt a bit weird to just make a change in clothes or tiny things like the color of the eyes. We ended up with this insect + human hybrid and I found it pretty fun to draw. This opens doors to more things like this in the future, so expect more elves, orcs and things like that.\n\n# Will Weddle have the same concept?\n\nAt the beginning yes, I would just change the patron and make something a bit more dark for Weddle. But I’m feeling more inclined to make a different story and go for a poison assassin story. Maybe they go through a long and ancient hibernation process that hardens their skin and opens a room to make the Kakuna design. \n\nI want to thank everyone that is giving amazing support so far. Weedle evolution line will probably be the last one of this year and after that we will take a break to prepare for next year. But we will probably be posting the Gijinkas that were commissioned in the last weeks of December, so you guys don’t have to wait a lot to see more Pokemon Gijinka art.\n\nWishing you all an amazing weekend!",

    "text": "Major win against scalpers in my area. (TLDR at the end)\n\nSo about 6 weeks ago I was hired on as a seasonal position at a very big warehouse store in my area that occasionally carries pokemon cards. \n\n3 days ago on Monday, i was helping folding clothing in the clothing department of the store where I overheard one of the overnight workers mention the newest sets of pokemon cards. Now, I usually keep to myself and avoid people at work but I'll take any chance to talk pokemon. \n\nSo I walk up to the guy and strike up a conversation about cards and what types we collect and as we're hitting it off the overnight manager walks over and asks \"Are yall walking about pokemon?\" Me and the coworker said yea and I was just about to ask if he also collected cards when he spoke up and asked \"So are yall scalpers?\" There was a brief pause of silence before me and the coworker erupted saying \"why would he say that\" and \"what the heck man?\"\nHe responded word for word: \"Cause I sell information about when we get cards to scalpers.\" With the smugest face imaginable. We asked what he mentioned and he said he sells them information on the exact day, time, what sets, and how many pokemon cards we get.\n\nMe and the coworker got very heated by that. We were saying \"how could you do that\" and that hes \"vile for doing such shit.\" He doubled down on it by saying he \"makes BANK\" doing it and that \"money is money.\" \n\nNow, the coworker gave up cause hes pretty buddy-buddy with that manager, I however, have been a major pokemon fan all my life and will take every chance to ruin a scalpers day and right before me was a person who feeds those parasites.\n\nSo I went and immediately reported him. I went to a manager who had a big jolteon and ash hat (kanto) pikachu tattoo and had to quickly explain since he was walking out the door when i saw him. The problem tho, the overnight manager has been with the company for 8 years, ive been there for 6 weeks. It'll be difficult to get them to believe my word over his...  or so I thought.\n\nI learned today that they immediately started an investigation into the guy and suspended him without pay until the investigation is completed, which I was so happy to hear. According to the good manager, he tried to play it off as \"just making conversation\" and \"playing a prank.\" (which is absolutely bs)\n\nI told them about the coworker with me and the exact date, time, and location it happened and ill tell them exactly in detail what went down next time I go in on Sunday. \n\nI despise pokemon card scalpers so to take down someone selling them information feels so rewarding.\n\nWill update when something happens.\n\nTLDR:\nThe overnight manager at my store admitted to selling information about the exact date and time of when we get pokemon cards in to scalpers and I reported him. He got suspended with no pay until the investigation is done.",

Instead of going through portals, you access the other Lumiose city via dreams and the main objective could be to find Darkrai and restore Cresselia's powers. Or, if they decided to keep Hoopa as a important characther, have it so Hoopa was sent by Cresselia who could have been imprisonned by Darkrai and your goal is to free her and restore her powers before Darkrai's nightmare world completely covers the real world",

Instead of going through portals, you access the other Lumiose city via dreams and the main objective could be to find Darkrai and restore Cresselia's powers. Or, if they decided to keep Hoopa as a important characther, have it so Hoopa was sent by Cresselia who could have been imprisonned by Darkrai and your goal is to free her and restore her powers before Darkrai's nightmare world completely covers the real world",

    "text": "Do you think we will get a second dlc for legends za or mega dimension part 2? With the dlc out now, it feels incomplete and rushed. It makes me thing we could get a part 2 of some sort. And no the post game of the dlc doesn’t count but it does hint more could be coming. I do think if they make a part 2 it must be perfect and not rushed. It should also be less grindy (including the main game) and more story based. Include new legendaries, forms, and villains. Have Volo return and maybe this mayor that Mable hates as villains. Bring back the rest of the Team Flare admins and let us go outside lumoise. If it’s a part 2 to mega dimension, perhaps show who made darkrai go through that since it wasn’t evil but used by some other higher Pokemon. Bring an actual A legendary for ZA which is chaotic and truly evil like Eternatus is.\n\nThe one key detail is that Pokemon has not announced a physical base game + dlc for the switch version and switch 2 edition yet like they always do since SWSH. And keep in mind they announce it when the final dlc for Swsh and sv was announced or was still in development meaning it may not be over and perhaps Pokemon day could announce a final part and the physical rereleases. Speaking of Pokemon day, the placeholder date was February 28, 2026. So could it be that they will release something to celebrate Pokémon’s 30th anniversary with legends ZA while they work on gen 10 for later next year or perhaps 2027?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Pokemon home is not compatible with the game yet and that usually means they’re saving it for dlc but since mega dimension is out it’s not even compatible yet.\n\nEdit 2: also take a look at this\n\n[https://x.com/ama\\_shinu/status/1965772165225308523?s=46](https://x.com/ama_shinu/status/1965772165225308523?s=46)\n\nIt’s been leaked by Khu if you keep looking which he got right we would get dlc so there is a chance for a second one\n\nBut what do you all think? A part 2 for mega dimension, a second separate dlc which may not correlate to mega dimension, physical rereleases with base game plus dlc for both switch and switch 2, or no second dlc?",

    "text": "Are there 2 dual type Pokemon that share the same primary type with different weaknesses? I can't find this discussed anywhere on the internet, so I've been wondering if there are two Pokemon that share a single type, whilst being dual type, and having different weaknesses. So lets say you got a flying fire pokemon and a flying rock type.\n\nI know they share weaknesses, and flying rock actually has more weaknesses, but imagine in another universe where that wasn't the case, and the typings actually cancelled eachother out, making it so that when fire and flying is paired together, it has completely or almost completely different weakness than rock flying.\n\nSo are there any real examples of that which exist? The main reason I ask is because sometimes when team building, I want to use 2 pokemon that share a type, but I don't use more than one type for coverage. If it was the case where they shared a type but due to their secondary typing, the weaknesses were different, I would love to use both those pokemon. Also it's an interesting question. Also it doesn't have to be the same primary type, it can also be the secondary type, as long as they share a type, with another type being different.",

Like OGD, Victini, and even Genesect are pokemon that just begging to be revisited in a meaningful other than just being cameos in other generation's games!\n\nOGD makes the most sense, given how it's the unique case of a legendary pokemon, technically being three pokemon into one. Seem the most logical to finally answer that.\n\nVictini could be the typical, adorable legendary pokemon that follows around in the early game only to have a sick final boss battle, where it unveils a new form or something with the power of friendship (cliche, I know...).\n\nGenesect could be the perfect mon to debut with team plasma's return since the events of BW1, we know that they have been directly involved with its creation! However, N put it onto hold since he believed that all pokemon are perfect and don't need to altered.\n\nThe only way you could get genesect and get it's lore was having a mystery gift (a sorta non canon) thing, most of the time at-least.\n\nGenesect being their final stand mon, would be a poetic swan song and show pathetic they have become but would at-least show they are very much still evil. Having Ghetsis (or standing his beliefs) evil belief that pokemon are to be used only as tools!\n\nAnd naturally, the player has to prove them wrong and save the suffering bug-steel mon.",

    "text": "TIFU by fainting at the vet's  (spoiler alert: no, I'm not a dog)\n\nToday two of my dogs had a full-on bitchfight. One ended up with a head wound that needed stitches, so off we go to the local vet dungeon a few villages down. It’s hot in there, it’s stuffy, it smells like formaldehyde and gorgonzola... it's so grimey it's like one of them escape rooms from the Saw movies. \n\nDog is beyond panicking (she's a spicy fucker).They tranquillise her with an injection but she stays in full goblin mode anyway.\n\nSo I end up helping one vet restrain her because (she was BIG MAD) while the other is stitching her and it’s basically a sweaty four-way between one sedated-but-still-feral dog, two small town Italian vets and me bent over the metal table (no such a thing as vet nurses around here, the pet owners do that job)\n\nMy stomach is mashed into the table edge (hello Vasovagal Syncope) the room is hot as bollocks and the dog won't stop whining and squirming around. \n\nThey shave and clean the area, they numb her with lidocaine and start stitching. I keep squashing myself against the table for a good 10-15 minutes under the hot lights. I stand up to change position. \n\nImmediate stars.\nImmediate tunnel vision.\nImmediate fuck my life. \n\nNext thing I know, I’m collapsing  into a metal shelf like a wet shopping bag.\n\nI come back to consciousness within seconds and the vet who was holding the dog with me is looking down at me shouting my name in Italian like a furious grandfather:\n\n“OP! CAZZO! TI HO VISTA CHE FACEVI LA SCEMA! COS’È SUCCESSO?!?”\n(Translation: “OP, FOR FUCK’S SAKE, I SAW YOU WERE BEING FUNNY, WHAT HAPPENED?!?”)\n\nMeanwhile the other vet is STILL stitching my dog with one hand while restraining her with the other and probably wondering if I'd been smoking meth.\n\nThey tell me to sit on the floor so I sort of limp / crawl  to lean against a desk because my brain has temporarily uninstalled.\n\nThen they offer me grappa (basically the Italian version of moonshine)\n\nI think it’s a joke.\nI laugh nervously.\nI’m like “haha… must be that cheeky Italian sense of humor under duress ✌🏼🙂”.\n\nNo.\n\nThey actually bring me a shot of grappa.\nAs medical care. So I take a tiny sip because hey, he's the  professional here right? Also it was already rude enough collapsing ok their filthy ass medical equipment, can't possibly say no 🥴 even tho with that I broke my 250 day sober streak 😭\n\n\nTHEN because this nightmare wasn’t absurd enough, I go to pay.\n\nThe bill is €50. The transaction is refused twice. I check my balance. I have €44 in my card, no cash. \n\nI try to bank transfer some more money from another savings account but because my brain is still operating on Windows 95 after the blackout, I fail to tick the \"instant transfer\" option (why is this even a thing?) and stand there confused as to why it’s not appearing.\n\nSo I sheepishly tell them I only have  €44 like an absolute dickhead and now I owe the vet six euros, and probably a shelf. \n\nDog is fine.\nMy back hurts.\nThe vet thinks fainting = lack of \"courage\" so basically called me a wimp 😤\n\nOh, also, they waved me goodbye as I had to drive home alone through dark twisty mountain roads with my fucked up back and even more fucked up dog. \n\nTL;DR: \nDog got stitches. I helped hold it down at a hot, stuffy vet, fainted, banged my back. Vet shouted at me, offered me liquor to recover from fainting. I accepted the liquor therefore breaking my 9 month sober streak. Bill €50, had €44, now owe €6. FML.",

Here we go.\n\nI was on one of those city buses that has that sudden *jerk-stop-then-yeet-forward* routine every few blocks. Since all the seats were taken, I was standing with my backpack slung over one shoulder, trying to look casual while checking the route on my phone.\n\nThe bus lurched, my backpack slid, and my whole center of gravity basically said, \"Good luck, girl.\" I stumbled forward, attempted to catch myself on one of those metal poles missed and ended up accidentally grabbing this poor guys ARM instead. I mean, full hand-wrap, like I was his Victorian wife fainting at the opera.\n\nThe guy just blinked at me. The woman behind him snorted. I apologized about nine times, and then, because the universe personally hates me, the bus lurched *again* and I bumped into him a second time. At that point, I just gave up on existing.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I finally got off, the driver called out, \"Careful now!\" as if I were a toddler learning to walk.\n\nI immediately texted my boyfriend, and he said it sounds on brand, which thanks?? I guess??\n\nAnyway, Im hiding in a café until the humiliation wears off.\n\nTL;DR: I lost my balance on a crowded bus, accidentally grabbed a strangers arm like we were in a soap opera, bumped into him again, and now Im dealing with the aftermath.",

After I was all done I looked over at my second monitor where I had discord open and saw a screenshot of our general chat page, in the bottom left corner of the screenshot was the video that I jacked off too.\n\nSomehow, in my infinite stupidity I forgot that I was streaming in a discord call (I had origonally opened my stream to show my friend my sick ass satisfactory power plant that I was working on) and forgot to close it. So this person exposed me in discord where all of my friends could see.\n\nLuckily this was at 2:00 am (about 30 minutes ago) and only one other person (afaik) saw the screenshot because they responded to it. This other person that saw it is a pretty chill guy, doesnt really take anything too seriously, he thought it was funny, as did I (after freaking out about it for 5 minutes). We DM'd back and forth joking about it, how it was probably a top 5 moments of things that had happened in our server, then he and I agreed that we should probably delete all the messages and just hope the guy who origonally saw it doesnt bring it up again.\n\nIn all honestly I dont think he will, he rarely ever hops into the discord calls but who knows, at this point im kind of whatever about it, I can probably laugh it off but lets just say that I learned a valuable lesson tonight. Never show anyone what youre doing in Satisfactory.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by forgetting to close my discord stream before watching porn and someone saw it.",

    "text": "TIFU by not going to my wife’s cousins funeral I (21 f) grew up christian and have a lot of religious trauma from purity culture and growing up as a lesbian in the church. my final straw with religion was after roe v wade was overturned and my congregation clapped and cheered. i was disgusted, walked out and never looked back. i made a vow to myself to never ever walk into another church in my life again. i met my wife (20 f) online and moved to utah from california to be with her. she grew up mormon (has sense left the church) but has a very active mormon family. i do not like the mormon church, from their shady history to what they did to my wife for being gay, i am not a fan of the religion to say the least. i live in utah and there is a mormon church on every corner and despite her families pleads to get my wife and i to go to church, i have successfully not stepped foot in a church or religious space since i made my promise to myself. \n\n My wife’s 4 year old cousin died from a disability he was born with and his parents were having his funeral in a mormon church. it is important to mention i have never met the parents or this child, i would only go to support my wife but supporting her would break my promise and the nature of the service (praying, reading verses, etc) would make me uncomfortable and trigger my religious trauma i have spent years trying to undo. plus as a visible lesbian i would not feel safe in a space like that. i told my wife i didn’t feel comfortable going to the funeral because it was in a church and she said it was fine and i didn’t have to go in but asked if could i drive with her. i sat in the parking lot during the service and when my wife got in the car after she was visibly upset. she was sad from the service but was also upset with me for not being there to comfort her during a traumatic time in her family. i was annoyed because she told me i didn’t have to go and if she wanted me to be there she should’ve just told me in the first place. we got in a huge argument. i felt guilty that i wasn’t there for my wife but i also didn’t want to be in a church, especially a mormon one, and going to the funeral would be crossing a important boundary i set for myself. i know i fucked up and should’ve just sucked it up for my wife’s sake and gotten over myself. we argued about what will happen when her parents or grandparents die and ended up not talking the rest of the night. we’ve had a tense couple of days and now her family is being weird towards me which has further damaged our relationship because they didn’t like me being “the lesbian who took their daughter away” in the first place. TL;DR i didn’t go to my wife’s cousins funeral because i don’t go into churches and now my wife and her family is mad at me",

    "text": "TIFU by baking cookies Today I fucked up by wanting to bake some cookies. It was a snow day yay! No school! But that meant lots of catching up to do boo! So to procrastinate, I twiddled my thumbs in the dinner room with some of my family, I mention that I’m craving chocolate (I’m on my period booo) and my little brother says we have half a bag of chocolate chips. Perfect, I have an excuse to do something that looks productive and I get sweets out of it. \nI get to baking, I’ve done chocolate chip cookies enough to know what I’m doing. But when I get to adding butter horror strikes as I used calcium butter and it makes the dough extremely sticky. To remedy this I added a butt load of flour, the dough was still a little sticky but good enough. I pop them into the oven and 10 minutes later out comes some really puffy cookies, bland but not bad. \nNow this is where I fucked up, I was talking about how I messed up the cookies with my dad and mentioned how I used “bad butter” (like it wasn’t right for this kind of thing) this set something off because he started to accuse me of not taking responsibility and not holding myself accountable by putting the blame on the butter. He proceeded to say “this is what’s wrong with America!” (???????) he’s been watching a lot more conservative/red pilled media and I think this related to that (?). \nI’m confused at this point and start to shut down (a bad habit of my when it comes to conflict) I tell him it’s not me deflecting my mistake just pointing out where I went wrong. He throws the cookie he was eating on the ground and says he doesn’t want it anymore and that I should throw the rest away (when I move to do that he stops me, so I don’t think he was being serious.) he tells me that I should prove that it’s the butter, so I can see for myself what went wrong and insists that we go to the store right now and buy more. I refuse since I didn’t want to do that and the whole point of making the cookies was to use the last of the chocolate chips. \nHe went to talk to my mother about going to the store I didn’t really hear what he said as I was getting ready to shovel the driveway. When he came back and I once again refused to go (reiterating my previous point and saying I had other things to do-like shovel the drive way) he interrupted me mid sentence and told me to “stop talking, don’t talk to me the rest of the day….your a disappointment”\nNow never have I ever heard him call me that, especially over cookies. At that point I had no idea how to react. I just stood there as he walked away, I could feel tears well in my eyes but I just couldn’t care I felt so tired that I took a moment and then went out to shovel. The cherry on top that literally less than 30 minutes ago he was hugging me and telling me how much he loved and how he’d take a butllet for me lol. \n\nTL;DR: I used the wrong butter when making cookies, I mentioned this to my dad (referring to it as “bad butter”) he took this as me not taking responsibility for my mistakes. When I refused to go to the store to buy more butter to test this he called me a disappointment.",

    "text": "TIFU by Trying to Impress My Date with a Home-Cooked Meal and Setting Off the Fire Alarm So, Ive been talking to this girl for a while, and weve had a few dates, but I thought Id really impress her by cooking a nice dinner at my place. You know, something thoughtful and romantic, right? So I decided to make a homemade pasta with a creamy sauce, garlic bread, and a fresh salad. Simple, but elegant.\n\nI spent hours in the kitchen, trying to follow the recipe, checking the ingredients over and over to make sure I wasnt missing anything. Everything seemed to be going great until I tried to fry the chicken for the pasta. I guess I got distracted by the sound of a movie playing in the background and... forgot the oil was getting too hot. You can guess what happened next. The chicken burned. Badly. I didnt want to ruin the whole thing, so I threw more oil in the pan to try and salvage it, but it just got worse.\n\nAt this point, I could smell smoke, and I looked around to see that a few paper towels had caught fire. Of course they had. I grabbed the first thing I could findmy dish toweland tried to swat out the flames, only to knock it into the frying pan, making everything worse. The smoke was so bad the entire apartment started filling up, and before I could even process it, the fire alarm started going off.\n\nI was frantically waving my arms, trying to turn off the alarm, but it only made it louder. Meanwhile, shes standing there, wide-eyed, not sure whether to laugh or be worried. I dont blame her.\n\nLong story short, we ended up eating frozen pizza and laughing at how much of a disaster my \"romantic\" dinner was. And as for the chicken and garlic bread? Well... let's just say I wont be cooking for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my date with a home-cooked dinner, caught my kitchen on fire, set off the fire alarm, and ended up ordering pizza instead.",

    "text": "TIFU by confidently assuming I could fix a “minor clog” I woke up this morning feeling way too good about myself for a Monday, which should’ve been the first warning sign. Look, the sink in my bathroom had been draining slowly for a few days, and instead of doing the sensible thing and calling maintenance, I decided to take it on myself. I watched one YouTube video - literally one - and immediately thought I was some kind of plumbing prodigy. Spoiler: I was not. I took the U‑bend off, fully expecting a clump of hair or something equally unpleasant. What I did NOT expect was for the pipe to basically burp out what I can only describe as primordial goo. It splattered all over the vanity, my shirt, and somehow the ceiling. I mean, I jerked back so hard I hit my elbow on the towel rack, which made me drop the U‑bend, which then rolled under the cabinet. I scrambled to grab it, knocked over the cleaning supplies, and managed to hit the open bottle of Drano, which then started slowly spreading across the floor like a chemical crime scene. In a panic, I tried to “temporarily” reattach the U‑bend while the sink was still open and dripping. I didn’t tighten it enough, so when I tested the water, it blasted out like a tiny busted fire hydrant, soaking the underside of the cabinet and every roll of toilet paper I owned. At this point my bathroom smelled like sewer soup and wet cardboard. That’s when maintenance knocked - turns out the downstairs neighbor had already reported water dripping from their ceiling. So now I’m standing there covered in mystery sludge, my sink is somehow worse than before, and the maintenance guy gives me the most defeated “why would you do this” look I’ve ever seen in my life. I just muttered something about “DIY confidence” and accepted my fate. TL;DR Tried to fix a slow drain with YouTube-level plumbing skills, unleashed bathroom chaos, soaked everything, and caused a leak into my neighbor’s apartment.",

I thought he was just being humorous but he was completely serious. Next thing I know, Im behind the counter as if I actually worked there.\n\nWithin five minutes, I managed to knock over an entire bin of metal clips.

I attempted to play it cool, but backed up too quickly and triggered a mini avalanche of water bottles.\n\nThe owner just let out a long, weary dad-sigh and handed me a free sticker that read adventure responsibly, which felt like the politest way to say youre done from a job I never really had. I left so quickly that I swear there was cartoon dust behind me. I texted my boyfriend about the whole ordeal, and he just replied with a laughing emoji, being the supportive king he is lol.\n\ntl;dr: I pretended to help out in a gear shop, instantly created chaos, hit my head, knocked things over, and got fired from a job I didnt even have.",

It was already nighttime, but he wanted me to see it right away. After some time driving, we stopped at a small old stone church on a little hill. The hill was actually a graveyard, since people were buried underneath it in unmarked graves.\n\nThe church was locked with a chain, so we sat in front of the doors. I was just telling my boyfriend how my friend and I used to tell our kids it was a princess’s castle because it looked like one.

    "text": "TIFU by being the only one who laughed at something said in spanish and outing my self on knowing spanish I work in a warehouse that is filled with mainly hispanics. My warehouse manager (tom), two other people (Jeff and Bill) and myself are the only non hispanic people. Everyone there mainly speaks spanish to one another unless they have to speak to Jeff, Bill or myself. Tom is fluent in spanish and speaks to them in spanish usually but speaks to us in english\n\n  \nWhen I got hired my warehouse manager brought we around and introduced me to a few people. With my background in warehouse management I got hired as a team lead. As a non hispanic person and younger than almost everyone I stuck out allot. I didn't mind and knew they would get to like me, especially once I told them I was married into a hispanic family and had aunts and uncles who were hispanic. I was also excited to speak to them in spanish as it's my second language and I always enjoy being able to speak it.\n\nWell during my tour of the place I got introduced to Jeff, Bill and other people I will be managing but before I got around to everyone there was side remarks from people saying in spanish after walking away about how it's stupid that some \"Young white boy\" is going to help manage a large group of hispanics. \n\nJeff and Bill, who were on the tour with Tom and myself, explained how they would be bullied at times for not speaking spanish and the others would constantly talk to them first in spanish and then say sorry and switch to english. Tom hired me specifically because of my past work with him and because he knew I understood spanish but also understands the majority of the people who work there are fluent in spanish as their 1st language and would not respect someone who doesn't understand it, which is why they bully Jeff and Bill at times.\n\nI understood the situation and did not mind, it would make me mad too if someone got hired to run a team that mainly spoke spanish and he didn't speak any spanish. However they didn't even give me a chance to let them know I can before judging me. \n\nAfter the tour Tom and I sat down in his office to go over the job and we spoke about me speaking spanish part and them automatically thinking I don't know it. He said that it's a typical warehouse where they will haze the new guy to make sure he's a good fit but they are all decent dudes who work hard. So we jokingly agreed we would joke with them back by not telling them I can speak spanish but only knew certain words to get by in the warehouse.\n\n  \nWell cut to about 9 months on the job. I've been doing a good job by this time leading my team. They respect and follow my lead for the most part. However they speak their minds in spanish about me to my face. At first I found it very disrespectful but after awhile I used it as a tool to help me manage them. \n\nWell one day while a group of us were in the breakroom someone was telling a joke in spanish. I was busy eating my lunch by myself as usual not really paying attention to what was being said. The person was who was telling the joke is the usual class clown but at times his humor can be a little immature for the other guys but I found most of it funny. \n\nWell during this particular joke no one got the punch line but I did, but not only did I get it but I laughed really hard and no one else was laughing but the guy who told the joke. \n\nThe entire room looked at me puzzled. I had nothing in front of me. No book, no phone, nothing. There is nothing I would be laughing at other than what he said. A few of them then started to crowed me and one started to talk to me in spanish asking me if I understood them. I pretended to be clueless till they got closer and closer till they had cornered me. He again, very close and tough like, asked me again if I understood them and if I lied and they found out later that I lied they would kick my ass. \n\nI'm much smaller than him and the person who was threatening was a felon, not that all felons are dangerous and bad people as allot of the people working there were ex cons, but I knew him enough to understand he was serious. So I spoke to him back in spanish.\n\nThe room got crazy and they allot of them started to realize that they have been talking shit their superiors face for the past 9 months. After a long talk with them they calmed down and actually thought it was hilarious and I now have allot more respect from them and I now talk to them all in spanish.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I did not tell the hispanic filled warehouse I spoke spanish until 9 months later I was the only one to laugh at a joke said in spanish and gave away my secret.",

    "text": "TIFU by having a Pavlovian sexual response to jelly beans  First, some context. When me and my wife got married last year, a relative of hers gave us a jar full of jelly beans (eloquently labeled as “Sex Beans”) that we had to take one out of whenever we did the devils tango, with the end goal to have it empty within a year. \n\n  Don’t ask why this relative gave us something like that, but just know they are the exact kind of person that you think would give a “gift” like that. \n\n Anyways, we decided to play along with the joke for a while and would take them out when stuff went down. I slowly began to get excited every time my wife would open the jar and pull one out to signal her intentions. It even got to the point where I saw those giant containers of them at Costco and it would give me the same response (shameful, I know. Down bad for the beans). \n\n Fast forward to today, apparently she had some friends coming over to the house before she got off work. It’s pretty typical for them to come over before she’s home, and I usually just say hi and continue working on my computer in a different room. \n\n   But today when I walked into the living room, I saw one of her friends grabbing a handful of the jelly beans throwing them into her mouth like a cartoon character. You can probably guess what started happening to me in that situation. \n\n  I was so friggin embarrassed and had to go shut the door on myself to tell my wife what happened. I told her on the phone while she was on her way home and she just started cackling in her car, didn’t help me much. \n\n  I felt bad for getting aroused by someone other than her, but it was just my body’s response to seeing the beans come from the jar. My wife was more amused than insulted it seems like and now she won’t let me forget about it. Oh well.\n\nTL:DR - Me and my wife got a gag gift with jelly beans to eat one every time we did the hanky panky. I developed a Pavlovian response to my wife with the beans so bad, that seeing someone else grabbed the beans got me going.",

    "text": "TIFU by giving my nephew a haircut Basically, he was scared to go to a barber and said when other family cut his hair it pulled a lot, so I told him I could do it for him since I know how to cut my own hair.\n\nEverything went fine, just a basic cut all around, but then it got to the front...Long story short, I cut too much around his forehead and now it looks weird. It's not horrible, but it's definitely a hairline that's an inch or so higher up than it should be. Not a LeBron James level hairline, but it's not normal either. Luckily he only has a week left of school before winter break, but I'm hoping it's not so bad where anyone at school makes fun of him about it because that's obviously not his fault.

Obviously it's a mistake but I feel so horrible over this, and of course all family members are pissed at me even though it's 95% fine minus that hairline and its not a mistake I'll make again. I'm sure we can all laugh about it...once the current hair grows back, but the weeks until then....\n\nIf I mess up on something that just impacts me I'm fine with because it's on me, but messing up on something that impacts someone else, and in this case a physical appearance, even if it's only temporary, I feel so awful over right now.\n\nTL;DR: Cut my nephews hair for the first time and I messed up his forehead/hairline where it's an inch or two higher up/shorter than it should be",

    "text": "TIFU by getting my friends hopes up about a New Year's party and then ditching them for my boyfriend Two years ago, I (22F) decided to spend new years with my two friends (21F and 22F) instead of my boyfriend (24M). The way I handled that situation was extremely shitty. I was so caught up in trying to \"please everyone\", that I ended up neglecting how my boyfriend felt, and making a decision that didn't even reflect what I actually wanted to do. This understandably caused a lot of conflict in my relationship which took months of communication to improve. I understand that spending new years together is important to him. I assured him that any plans for new years would involve him going forward. \n\nMy two friends expressed to me last week that they wanted to spend new years together. They said they'd be depressed if they ended up doing nothing. I remembered that my boyfriend mentioned that he might be hosting a New Year's party and I'd let them know if they could come.\n\nThis understandably got their hopes up and the week after, they asked me about it. I sent my boyfriend a text to ask and he let me know that he was planning on going through with it. I stupidly told them straight away that the party was happening. I asked him if they could come, and he informed me that he'd prefer if they didn't as he wanted it to just be close family and friends. \n\nI told my boyfriend the situation I was in and how my friends have been telling me how upset they'll be if we don't do anything. Looking back, this was a shitty thing to say, because my friend's feelings have nothing to do with him. I realise now that I was putting pressure on my boyfriend to \"fix\" this problem by inviting two people to the party that he didn't even want there (and that we have had issues with over in the past). \n\nI very quickly recognised what was happening and I knew that I had to put my foot down and stop this behaviour. I knew that I had to tell my friends that I wasn't going to spend new years with them. \n\nAt this point I know that I've already upset my boyfriend and that I should have never mentioned the party in the first place. I should have told them immediately that I was going to spend new years with him instead of trying to orchestrate some sort of \"solution\" at the detriment of my boyfriend. \n\nI sent them a message last night explaining that I was not going to be spending new years with them. I let them know that I didn't realise that the party was only going to be close family and friends and that I felt awful for getting their hopes and then jumping ship.\n\nKnowing my friends, I know that they won't end up doing anything for new years because I have pulled out. I have messed this whole situation up so badly and upset both sides. I feel terrible. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI tried to avoid conflict with my friends by inviting them to my boyfriend's New Year's party without stopping to consider what he wanted. After finding out that he didn't want them at the party, I had ended up canceling on my friends and letting them down after getting their hopes up.",

She was at her family’s home out of town and I was at my house. She has an iPhone so her iCloud is synced with her Macbook. Anyway a while later something happened with my iMessage connection and my pictures were not sending. They just stayed blue on my end. We ended our little session and went on with our days. \n\nAbout an hour later on the other end, my gf was using her Macbook and was showing her family something work-related on it. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, my iMessage finally delivered the picture. She clicked on the notification thingy thinking I sent a regular message. It was not. It was a close up of my fully erect penis, blasted on the screen in full view. She said she slammed the laptop down as fast as she could but it was too late. Her father, mother, and brother all seen what was on the screen. She said there was an awkward silence after that and the brother just said “oooohhhkay then”. Nobody has spoken of it and it seems to be a toss it under the rug and never speak about it thing.\n\nTL;DR I accidentally blasted my gf’s laptop screen with my meat in front of her family because my iMessage was too slow to send the pictures.",

    "text": "TIFU by being the only one who laughed at something said in spanish and outing my self on knowing spanish I work in a warehouse that is filled with mainly hispanics. My warehouse manager (tom), two other people (Jeff and Bill) and myself are the only non hispanic people. Everyone there mainly speaks spanish to one another unless they have to speak to Jeff, Bill or myself. Tom is fluent in spanish and speaks to them in spanish usually but speaks to us in english\n\n  \nWhen I got hired my warehouse manager brought we around and introduced me to a few people. With my background in warehouse management I got hired as a team lead. As a non hispanic person and younger than almost everyone I stuck out allot. I didn't mind and knew they would get to like me, especially once I told them I was married into a hispanic family and had aunts and uncles who were hispanic. I was also excited to speak to them in spanish as it's my second language and I always enjoy being able to speak it.\n\nWell during my tour of the place I got introduced to Jeff, Bill and other people I will be managing but before I got around to everyone there was side remarks from people saying in spanish after walking away about how it's stupid that some \"Young white boy\" is going to help manage a large group of hispanics. \n\nJeff and Bill, who were on the tour with Tom and myself, explained how they would be bullied at times for not speaking spanish and the others would constantly talk to them first in spanish and then say sorry and switch to english. Tom hired me specifically because of my past work with him and because he knew I understood spanish but also understands the majority of the people who work there are fluent in spanish as their 1st language and would not respect someone who doesn't understand it, which is why they bully Jeff and Bill at times.\n\nI understood the situation and did not mind, it would make me mad too if someone got hired to run a team that mainly spoke spanish and he didn't speak any spanish. However they didn't even give me a chance to let them know I can before judging me. \n\nAfter the tour Tom and I sat down in his office to go over the job and we spoke about me speaking spanish part and them automatically thinking I don't know it. He said that it's a typical warehouse where they will haze the new guy to make sure he's a good fit but they are all decent dudes who work hard. So we jokingly agreed we would joke with them back by not telling them I can speak spanish but only knew certain words to get by in the warehouse.\n\n  \nWell cut to about 9 months on the job. I've been doing a good job by this time leading my team. They respect and follow my lead for the most part. However they speak their minds in spanish about me to my face. At first I found it very disrespectful but after awhile I used it as a tool to help me manage them. \n\nWell one day while a group of us were in the breakroom someone was telling a joke in spanish. I was busy eating my lunch by myself as usual not really paying attention to what was being said. The person was who was telling the joke is the usual class clown but at times his humor can be a little immature for the other guys but I found most of it funny. \n\nWell during this particular joke no one got the punch line but I did, but not only did I get it but I laughed really hard and no one else was laughing but the guy who told the joke. \n\nThe entire room looked at me puzzled. I had nothing in front of me. No book, no phone, nothing. There is nothing I would be laughing at other than what he said. A few of them then started to crowed me and one started to talk to me in spanish asking me if I understood them. I pretended to be clueless till they got closer and closer till they had cornered me. He again, very close and tough like, asked me again if I understood them and if I lied and they found out later that I lied they would kick my ass. \n\nI'm much smaller than him and the person who was threatening was a felon, not that all felons are dangerous and bad people as allot of the people working there were ex cons, but I knew him enough to understand he was serious. So I spoke to him back in spanish.\n\nThe room got crazy and they allot of them started to realize that they have been talking shit their superiors face for the past 9 months. After a long talk with them they calmed down and actually thought it was hilarious and I now have allot more respect from them and I now talk to them all in spanish.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I did not tell the hispanic filled warehouse I spoke spanish until 9 months later I was the only one to laugh at a joke said in spanish and gave away my secret.",

    "text": "TIFU by having a Pavlovian sexual response to jelly beans  First, some context. When me and my wife got married last year, a relative of hers gave us a jar full of jelly beans (eloquently labeled as “Sex Beans”) that we had to take one out of whenever we did the devils tango, with the end goal to have it empty within a year. \n\n  Don’t ask why this relative gave us something like that, but just know they are the exact kind of person that you think would give a “gift” like that. \n\n Anyways, we decided to play along with the joke for a while and would take them out when stuff went down. I slowly began to get excited every time my wife would open the jar and pull one out to signal her intentions. It even got to the point where I saw those giant containers of them at Costco and it would give me the same response (shameful, I know. Down bad for the beans). \n\n Fast forward to today, apparently she had some friends coming over to the house before she got off work. It’s pretty typical for them to come over before she’s home, and I usually just say hi and continue working on my computer in a different room. \n\n   But today when I walked into the living room, I saw one of her friends grabbing a handful of the jelly beans throwing them into her mouth like a cartoon character. You can probably guess what started happening to me in that situation. \n\n  I was so friggin embarrassed and had to go shut the door on myself to tell my wife what happened. I told her on the phone while she was on her way home and she just started cackling in her car, didn’t help me much. \n\n  I felt bad for getting aroused by someone other than her, but it was just my body’s response to seeing the beans come from the jar. My wife was more amused than insulted it seems like and now she won’t let me forget about it. Oh well.\n\nTL:DR - Me and my wife got a gag gift with jelly beans to eat one every time we did the hanky panky. I developed a Pavlovian response to my wife with the beans so bad, that seeing someone else grabbed the beans got me going.",

Today was already stressful and I was honestly in a bad mood. My boss has this habit of micromanaging everything and correcting people over the smallest details, and today he did it again in front of everyone.\nFast forward to my lunch break. I go into the break room, put my headphones on, and call a friend to vent. I was convinced I was alone. I didn’t see or hear anyone else, so I just let it all out.\nI complained about my boss. Like really complained. I said he’s insecure, that he loves hearing his own voice, that if he spent half as much time doing real work as he does hovering over people, the office would actually run better. I even joked that he probably practices giving feedback in the mirror at home.\n\nI’m mid rant, feeling relieved, when I turn around to grab my water bottle.\nAnd there he is.\n\nMy boss.\n\nSitting at the small table in the corner, absolutely still, staring straight at me. No headphones. No phone. Just… listening.\n\nWe made eye contact. A solid two seconds of silence. Enough time for my soul to leave my body and file for permanent resignation.\n\nI froze. He slowly stood up, looked me dead in the eyes, and said, “Interesting feedback.”\n\nThen he walked out.\n\nI spent the rest of my lunch break considering fake illnesses, career changes, and moving to a different country. He hasn’t said anything since, but every time I hear footsteps behind me, my life flashes before my eyes.\n\nTL;DR: Thought I was alone, talked shit about my boss on the phone, he was sitting behind me the entire time and heard everything",

    "text": "TIFU by fainting at the vet's  (spoiler alert: no, I'm not a dog)\n\nToday two of my dogs had a full-on bitchfight. One ended up with a head wound that needed stitches, so off we go to the local vet dungeon a few villages down. It’s hot in there, it’s stuffy, it smells like formaldehyde and gorgonzola... it's so grimey it's like one of them escape rooms from the Saw movies. \n\nDog is beyond panicking (she's a spicy fucker).They tranquillise her with an injection but she stays in full goblin mode anyway.\n\nSo I end up helping one vet restrain her because (she was BIG MAD) while the other is stitching her and it’s basically a sweaty four-way between one sedated-but-still-feral dog, two small town Italian vets and me bent over the metal table (no such a thing as vet nurses around here, the pet owners do that job)\n\nMy stomach is mashed into the table edge (hello Vasovagal Syncope) the room is hot as bollocks and the dog won't stop whining and squirming around. \n\nThey shave and clean the area, they numb her with lidocaine and start stitching. I keep squashing myself against the table for a good 10-15 minutes under the hot lights. I stand up to change position. \n\nImmediate stars.\nImmediate tunnel vision.\nImmediate fuck my life. \n\nNext thing I know, I’m collapsing  into a metal shelf like a wet shopping bag.\n\nI come back to consciousness within seconds and the vet who was holding the dog with me is looking down at me shouting my name in Italian like a furious grandfather:\n\n“OP! CAZZO! TI HO VISTA CHE FACEVI LA SCEMA! COS’È SUCCESSO?!?”\n(Translation: “OP, FOR FUCK’S SAKE, I SAW YOU WERE BEING FUNNY, WHAT HAPPENED?!?”)\n\nMeanwhile the other vet is STILL stitching my dog with one hand while restraining her with the other and probably wondering if I'd been smoking meth.\n\nThey tell me to sit on the floor so I sort of limp / crawl  to lean against a desk because my brain has temporarily uninstalled.\n\nThen they offer me grappa (basically the Italian version of moonshine)\n\nI think it’s a joke.\nI laugh nervously.\nI’m like “haha… must be that cheeky Italian sense of humor under duress ✌🏼🙂”.\n\nNo.\n\nThey actually bring me a shot of grappa.\nAs medical care. So I take a tiny sip because hey, he's the  professional here right? Also it was already rude enough collapsing ok their filthy ass medical equipment, can't possibly say no 🥴 even tho with that I broke my 250 day sober streak 😭\n\n\nTHEN because this nightmare wasn’t absurd enough, I go to pay.\n\nThe bill is €50. The transaction is refused twice. I check my balance. I have €44 in my card, no cash. \n\nI try to bank transfer some more money from another savings account but because my brain is still operating on Windows 95 after the blackout, I fail to tick the \"instant transfer\" option (why is this even a thing?) and stand there confused as to why it’s not appearing.\n\nSo I sheepishly tell them I only have  €44 like an absolute dickhead and now I owe the vet six euros, and probably a shelf. \n\nDog is fine.\nMy back hurts.\nThe vet thinks fainting = lack of \"courage\" so basically called me a wimp 😤\n\nOh, also, they waved me goodbye as I had to drive home alone through dark twisty mountain roads with my fucked up back and even more fucked up dog. \n\nTL;DR: \nDog got stitches. I helped hold it down at a hot, stuffy vet, fainted, banged my back. Vet shouted at me, offered me liquor to recover from fainting. I accepted the liquor therefore breaking my 9 month sober streak. Bill €50, had €44, now owe €6. FML.",

    "text": "TIFU by confidently assuming I could fix a “minor clog” I woke up this morning feeling way too good about myself for a Monday, which should’ve been the first warning sign. Look, the sink in my bathroom had been draining slowly for a few days, and instead of doing the sensible thing and calling maintenance, I decided to take it on myself. I watched one YouTube video - literally one - and immediately thought I was some kind of plumbing prodigy. Spoiler: I was not. I took the U‑bend off, fully expecting a clump of hair or something equally unpleasant. What I did NOT expect was for the pipe to basically burp out what I can only describe as primordial goo. It splattered all over the vanity, my shirt, and somehow the ceiling. I mean, I jerked back so hard I hit my elbow on the towel rack, which made me drop the U‑bend, which then rolled under the cabinet. I scrambled to grab it, knocked over the cleaning supplies, and managed to hit the open bottle of Drano, which then started slowly spreading across the floor like a chemical crime scene. In a panic, I tried to “temporarily” reattach the U‑bend while the sink was still open and dripping. I didn’t tighten it enough, so when I tested the water, it blasted out like a tiny busted fire hydrant, soaking the underside of the cabinet and every roll of toilet paper I owned. At this point my bathroom smelled like sewer soup and wet cardboard. That’s when maintenance knocked - turns out the downstairs neighbor had already reported water dripping from their ceiling. So now I’m standing there covered in mystery sludge, my sink is somehow worse than before, and the maintenance guy gives me the most defeated “why would you do this” look I’ve ever seen in my life. I just muttered something about “DIY confidence” and accepted my fate. TL;DR Tried to fix a slow drain with YouTube-level plumbing skills, unleashed bathroom chaos, soaked everything, and caused a leak into my neighbor’s apartment.",

    "text": "TIFU by baking cookies Today I fucked up by wanting to bake some cookies. It was a snow day yay! No school! But that meant lots of catching up to do boo! So to procrastinate, I twiddled my thumbs in the dinner room with some of my family, I mention that I’m craving chocolate (I’m on my period booo) and my little brother says we have half a bag of chocolate chips. Perfect, I have an excuse to do something that looks productive and I get sweets out of it. \nI get to baking, I’ve done chocolate chip cookies enough to know what I’m doing. But when I get to adding butter horror strikes as I used calcium butter and it makes the dough extremely sticky. To remedy this I added a butt load of flour, the dough was still a little sticky but good enough. I pop them into the oven and 10 minutes later out comes some really puffy cookies, bland but not bad. \nNow this is where I fucked up, I was talking about how I messed up the cookies with my dad and mentioned how I used “bad butter” (like it wasn’t right for this kind of thing) this set something off because he started to accuse me of not taking responsibility and not holding myself accountable by putting the blame on the butter. He proceeded to say “this is what’s wrong with America!” (???????) he’s been watching a lot more conservative/red pilled media and I think this related to that (?). \nI’m confused at this point and start to shut down (a bad habit of my when it comes to conflict) I tell him it’s not me deflecting my mistake just pointing out where I went wrong. He throws the cookie he was eating on the ground and says he doesn’t want it anymore and that I should throw the rest away (when I move to do that he stops me, so I don’t think he was being serious.) he tells me that I should prove that it’s the butter, so I can see for myself what went wrong and insists that we go to the store right now and buy more. I refuse since I didn’t want to do that and the whole point of making the cookies was to use the last of the chocolate chips. \nHe went to talk to my mother about going to the store I didn’t really hear what he said as I was getting ready to shovel the driveway. When he came back and I once again refused to go (reiterating my previous point and saying I had other things to do-like shovel the drive way) he interrupted me mid sentence and told me to “stop talking, don’t talk to me the rest of the day….your a disappointment”\nNow never have I ever heard him call me that, especially over cookies. At that point I had no idea how to react. I just stood there as he walked away, I could feel tears well in my eyes but I just couldn’t care I felt so tired that I took a moment and then went out to shovel. The cherry on top that literally less than 30 minutes ago he was hugging me and telling me how much he loved and how he’d take a butllet for me lol. \n\nTL;DR: I used the wrong butter when making cookies, I mentioned this to my dad (referring to it as “bad butter”) he took this as me not taking responsibility for my mistakes. When I refused to go to the store to buy more butter to test this he called me a disappointment.",

    "text": "TIFU by trying to adopt someone's kid I (45 F) was scrolling FB and came across a post in a local group that said \"Looking for someone to adopt my child for Christmas, please message me\" \n\nIdk why I thought she didnt want her kid anymore and I messaged her that I would take her child. \n\nMy husband and I had been trying to have children of our own but I've had many miscarriages and I gave up on trying. \n\nMy mind went to horrible things that have happened to children by parents who dont want them and if this person was reaching out for someone to take them. There were no comments on the post so my dumb ass messaged her. \n\nTurns out she was just looking for someone to buy Christmas presents for her child. She said I was weird and blocked me before I could explain. \n\nI think its weird the way she worded it as adopting her kid for Christmas. But I feel like such a creepy asshole now amd cant stop thinking about this poor mother thinks I was trying to steal her child. \n\nJust wanted to vent this hear to get it off my chest. \n\nTL;DR: a woman posted on FB she was looking for someone to adopt her child for Christmas and I misunderstood the assignment. I messaged her that I would be willing to adopt. She just wanted someone to buy presents for her child. Now this woman thinks I was trying to take her baby and she blocked me.",

    "text": "TIFU by Trying to Impress My Date with a Home-Cooked Meal and Setting Off the Fire Alarm So, Ive been talking to this girl for a while, and weve had a few dates, but I thought Id really impress her by cooking a nice dinner at my place. You know, something thoughtful and romantic, right? So I decided to make a homemade pasta with a creamy sauce, garlic bread, and a fresh salad. Simple, but elegant.\n\nI spent hours in the kitchen, trying to follow the recipe, checking the ingredients over and over to make sure I wasnt missing anything. Everything seemed to be going great until I tried to fry the chicken for the pasta. I guess I got distracted by the sound of a movie playing in the background and... forgot the oil was getting too hot. You can guess what happened next. The chicken burned. Badly. I didnt want to ruin the whole thing, so I threw more oil in the pan to try and salvage it, but it just got worse.\n\nAt this point, I could smell smoke, and I looked around to see that a few paper towels had caught fire. Of course they had. I grabbed the first thing I could findmy dish toweland tried to swat out the flames, only to knock it into the frying pan, making everything worse. The smoke was so bad the entire apartment started filling up, and before I could even process it, the fire alarm started going off.\n\nI was frantically waving my arms, trying to turn off the alarm, but it only made it louder. Meanwhile, shes standing there, wide-eyed, not sure whether to laugh or be worried. I dont blame her.\n\nLong story short, we ended up eating frozen pizza and laughing at how much of a disaster my \"romantic\" dinner was. And as for the chicken and garlic bread? Well... let's just say I wont be cooking for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my date with a home-cooked dinner, caught my kitchen on fire, set off the fire alarm, and ended up ordering pizza instead.",

    "text": "TIFU by trying to look professional on Zoom So today I had a big virtual meeting with several managers and my boss the kind of meeting where everyone suddenly pretends they’ve had their life together for years.\n\nNaturally, I decided to level up my professionalism by putting on a button-up shirt… while still wearing pajama shorts that have cartoon bananas on them. You know, the classic Zoom mullet: business on top, sleepover on the bottom.\n\nI tested my camera beforehand, everything looked fine shoulders up, very CEO. I even practiced my I’m paying attention face.\n\nThe meeting starts, and surprisingly, I’m doing great. I’m nodding at the right times, pretending to take notes, keeping my face in that expression that says I absolutely understand this graph. Life was peaceful.\n\nThen my cat decided to unleash a demon.\n\nOut of nowhere, she lets out this bloodcurdling scream like she just saw the ghost of every cat who came before her. She’s knocking things off shelves, sprinting around like her tail is on fire, doing parkour off my furniture. I panic, because of course I do.\n\nWithout thinking without remembering the sacred rule of video calls I stand up to grab her.\n\nInstant regret.........\n\nThe camera, blessed with a wide-angle lens I didn’t realize it had, goes from corporate professionalism to man-child in pajama shorts starring in his own sitcom.\n\nThere was a moment a single silent second where I could see my own soul leave my body.\n\nThen someone unmuted and said, perfectly calmly,\n\nNice shorts, dude\n\nAnd the worst part..\n\nEveryone just carried on..\n\nNo laughter. No roasting. No pretending they didn’t see it.\n\nJust… back to quarterly projections like my legs weren’t covered in cartoon fruit.\n\nI spent the rest of the meeeting wishing my WiFi would explode, disconnect, or spontaneously combust. I would’ve accepted being sucked into a wormhole. Anything.\n\nTL;DR: Wore a business shirt and banana-print pajama shorts to a serious Zoom meeeting. Cat went feral, I stood up on camera, exposed my outfit, someone said Nice shorts, dude, and the meeeting carried on like nothing happened. I died internally.",

    "text": "TIFU by not going to my wife’s cousins funeral I (21 f) grew up christian and have a lot of religious trauma from purity culture and growing up as a lesbian in the church. my final straw with religion was after roe v wade was overturned and my congregation clapped and cheered. i was disgusted, walked out and never looked back. i made a vow to myself to never ever walk into another church in my life again. i met my wife (20 f) online and moved to utah from california to be with her. she grew up mormon (has sense left the church) but has a very active mormon family. i do not like the mormon church, from their shady history to what they did to my wife for being gay, i am not a fan of the religion to say the least. i live in utah and there is a mormon church on every corner and despite her families pleads to get my wife and i to go to church, i have successfully not stepped foot in a church or religious space since i made my promise to myself. \n\n My wife’s 4 year old cousin died from a disability he was born with and his parents were having his funeral in a mormon church. it is important to mention i have never met the parents or this child, i would only go to support my wife but supporting her would break my promise and the nature of the service (praying, reading verses, etc) would make me uncomfortable and trigger my religious trauma i have spent years trying to undo. plus as a visible lesbian i would not feel safe in a space like that. i told my wife i didn’t feel comfortable going to the funeral because it was in a church and she said it was fine and i didn’t have to go in but asked if could i drive with her. i sat in the parking lot during the service and when my wife got in the car after she was visibly upset. she was sad from the service but was also upset with me for not being there to comfort her during a traumatic time in her family. i was annoyed because she told me i didn’t have to go and if she wanted me to be there she should’ve just told me in the first place. we got in a huge argument. i felt guilty that i wasn’t there for my wife but i also didn’t want to be in a church, especially a mormon one, and going to the funeral would be crossing a important boundary i set for myself. i know i fucked up and should’ve just sucked it up for my wife’s sake and gotten over myself. we argued about what will happen when her parents or grandparents die and ended up not talking the rest of the night. we’ve had a tense couple of days and now her family is being weird towards me which has further damaged our relationship because they didn’t like me being “the lesbian who took their daughter away” in the first place. TL;DR i didn’t go to my wife’s cousins funeral because i don’t go into churches and now my wife and her family is mad at me",

It was already nighttime, but he wanted me to see it right away. After some time driving, we stopped at a small old stone church on a little hill. The hill was actually a graveyard, since people were buried underneath it in unmarked graves.\n\nThe church was locked with a chain, so we sat in front of the doors. I was just telling my boyfriend how my friend and I used to tell our kids it was a princess’s castle because it looked like one. Then I sang a song called “Princess, Say Hello” just for fun.\n\nAnd then we heard five rhythmic knocks from inside.\n\nCold horror climbed up my spine. We both looked at each other, stood up instantly, and ran. I shouted, “We’ll come back to save you, Princess, when we find the courage!”\nBut we still haven’t.\nMaybe one day in the future.\n\nTL;DR I called out to a deceased princess in an abandoned, locked church, and someone answered by knocking.",

    "text": "TIFU by jacking off in a discord call. After a long day of gaming on my day off, after all the boys had left the discord call, I decided to masturbate before I went to bed. I booted up the old pornhub and did the deed. After I was all done I looked over at my second monitor where I had discord open and saw a screenshot of our general chat page, in the bottom left corner of the screenshot was the video that I jacked off too.\n\nSomehow, in my infinite stupidity I forgot that I was streaming in a discord call (I had origonally opened my stream to show my friend my sick ass satisfactory power plant that I was working on) and forgot to close it. So this person exposed me in discord where all of my friends could see.\n\nLuckily this was at 2:00 am (about 30 minutes ago) and only one other person (afaik) saw the screenshot because they responded to it. This other person that saw it is a pretty chill guy, doesnt really take anything too seriously, he thought it was funny, as did I (after freaking out about it for 5 minutes). We DM'd back and forth joking about it, how it was probably a top 5 moments of things that had happened in our server, then he and I agreed that we should probably delete all the messages and just hope the guy who origonally saw it doesnt bring it up again.\n\nIn all honestly I dont think he will, he rarely ever hops into the discord calls but who knows, at this point im kind of whatever about it, I can probably laugh it off but lets just say that I learned a valuable lesson tonight. Never show anyone what youre doing in Satisfactory.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by forgetting to close my discord stream before watching porn and someone saw it.",

    "text": "TIFU by being the only one who laughed at something said in spanish and outing my self on knowing spanish I work in a warehouse that is filled with mainly hispanics. My warehouse manager (tom), two other people (Jeff and Bill) and myself are the only non hispanic people. Everyone there mainly speaks spanish to one another unless they have to speak to Jeff, Bill or myself. Tom is fluent in spanish and speaks to them in spanish usually but speaks to us in english\n\n  \nWhen I got hired my warehouse manager brought we around and introduced me to a few people. With my background in warehouse management I got hired as a team lead. As a non hispanic person and younger than almost everyone I stuck out allot. I didn't mind and knew they would get to like me, especially once I told them I was married into a hispanic family and had aunts and uncles who were hispanic. I was also excited to speak to them in spanish as it's my second language and I always enjoy being able to speak it.\n\nWell during my tour of the place I got introduced to Jeff, Bill and other people I will be managing but before I got around to everyone there was side remarks from people saying in spanish after walking away about how it's stupid that some \"Young white boy\" is going to help manage a large group of hispanics. \n\nJeff and Bill, who were on the tour with Tom and myself, explained how they would be bullied at times for not speaking spanish and the others would constantly talk to them first in spanish and then say sorry and switch to english. Tom hired me specifically because of my past work with him and because he knew I understood spanish but also understands the majority of the people who work there are fluent in spanish as their 1st language and would not respect someone who doesn't understand it, which is why they bully Jeff and Bill at times.\n\nI understood the situation and did not mind, it would make me mad too if someone got hired to run a team that mainly spoke spanish and he didn't speak any spanish. However they didn't even give me a chance to let them know I can before judging me. \n\nAfter the tour Tom and I sat down in his office to go over the job and we spoke about me speaking spanish part and them automatically thinking I don't know it. He said that it's a typical warehouse where they will haze the new guy to make sure he's a good fit but they are all decent dudes who work hard. So we jokingly agreed we would joke with them back by not telling them I can speak spanish but only knew certain words to get by in the warehouse.\n\n  \nWell cut to about 9 months on the job. I've been doing a good job by this time leading my team. They respect and follow my lead for the most part. However they speak their minds in spanish about me to my face. At first I found it very disrespectful but after awhile I used it as a tool to help me manage them. \n\nWell one day while a group of us were in the breakroom someone was telling a joke in spanish. I was busy eating my lunch by myself as usual not really paying attention to what was being said. The person was who was telling the joke is the usual class clown but at times his humor can be a little immature for the other guys but I found most of it funny. \n\nWell during this particular joke no one got the punch line but I did, but not only did I get it but I laughed really hard and no one else was laughing but the guy who told the joke. \n\nThe entire room looked at me puzzled. I had nothing in front of me. No book, no phone, nothing. There is nothing I would be laughing at other than what he said. A few of them then started to crowed me and one started to talk to me in spanish asking me if I understood them. I pretended to be clueless till they got closer and closer till they had cornered me. He again, very close and tough like, asked me again if I understood them and if I lied and they found out later that I lied they would kick my ass. \n\nI'm much smaller than him and the person who was threatening was a felon, not that all felons are dangerous and bad people as allot of the people working there were ex cons, but I knew him enough to understand he was serious. So I spoke to him back in spanish.\n\nThe room got crazy and they allot of them started to realize that they have been talking shit their superiors face for the past 9 months. After a long talk with them they calmed down and actually thought it was hilarious and I now have allot more respect from them and I now talk to them all in spanish.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I did not tell the hispanic filled warehouse I spoke spanish until 9 months later I was the only one to laugh at a joke said in spanish and gave away my secret.",

    "text": "TIFU by having a Pavlovian sexual response to jelly beans  First, some context. When me and my wife got married last year, a relative of hers gave us a jar full of jelly beans (eloquently labeled as “Sex Beans”) that we had to take one out of whenever we did the devils tango, with the end goal to have it empty within a year. \n\n  Don’t ask why this relative gave us something like that, but just know they are the exact kind of person that you think would give a “gift” like that. \n\n Anyways, we decided to play along with the joke for a while and would take them out when stuff went down. I slowly began to get excited every time my wife would open the jar and pull one out to signal her intentions. It even got to the point where I saw those giant containers of them at Costco and it would give me the same response (shameful, I know. Down bad for the beans). \n\n Fast forward to today, apparently she had some friends coming over to the house before she got off work. It’s pretty typical for them to come over before she’s home, and I usually just say hi and continue working on my computer in a different room. \n\n   But today when I walked into the living room, I saw one of her friends grabbing a handful of the jelly beans throwing them into her mouth like a cartoon character. You can probably guess what started happening to me in that situation. \n\n  I was so friggin embarrassed and had to go shut the door on myself to tell my wife what happened. I told her on the phone while she was on her way home and she just started cackling in her car, didn’t help me much. \n\n  I felt bad for getting aroused by someone other than her, but it was just my body’s response to seeing the beans come from the jar. My wife was more amused than insulted it seems like and now she won’t let me forget about it. Oh well.\n\nTL:DR - Me and my wife got a gag gift with jelly beans to eat one every time we did the hanky panky. I developed a Pavlovian response to my wife with the beans so bad, that seeing someone else grabbed the beans got me going.",

Today was already stressful and I was honestly in a bad mood.

I go into the break room, put my headphones on, and call a friend to vent. I was convinced I was alone. I didn’t see or hear anyone else, so I just let it all out.\nI complained about my boss. Like really complained. I said he’s insecure, that he loves hearing his own voice, that if he spent half as much time doing real work as he does hovering over people, the office would actually run better. I even joked that he probably practices giving feedback in the mirror at home.\n\nI’m mid rant, feeling relieved, when I turn around to grab my water bottle.\nAnd there he is.\n\nMy boss.\n\nSitting at the small table in the corner, absolutely still, staring straight at me. No headphones. No phone. Just… listening.\n\nWe made eye contact. A solid two seconds of silence. Enough time for my soul to leave my body and file for permanent resignation.\n\nI froze. He slowly stood up, looked me dead in the eyes, and said, “Interesting feedback.”\n\nThen he walked out.\n\nI spent the rest of my lunch break considering fake illnesses, career changes, and moving to a different country. He hasn’t said anything since, but every time I hear footsteps behind me, my life flashes before my eyes.\n\nTL;DR: Thought I was alone, talked shit about my boss on the phone, he was sitting behind me the entire time and heard everything",

    "text": "TIFU by getting my friends hopes up about a New Year's party and then ditching them for my boyfriend Two years ago, I (22F) decided to spend new years with my two friends (21F and 22F) instead of my boyfriend (24M). The way I handled that situation was extremely shitty. I was so caught up in trying to \"please everyone\", that I ended up neglecting how my boyfriend felt, and making a decision that didn't even reflect what I actually wanted to do. This understandably caused a lot of conflict in my relationship which took months of communication to improve. I understand that spending new years together is important to him. I assured him that any plans for new years would involve him going forward. \n\nMy two friends expressed to me last week that they wanted to spend new years together. They said they'd be depressed if they ended up doing nothing. I remembered that my boyfriend mentioned that he might be hosting a New Year's party and I'd let them know if they could come.\n\nThis understandably got their hopes up and the week after, they asked me about it. I sent my boyfriend a text to ask and he let me know that he was planning on going through with it. I stupidly told them straight away that the party was happening. I asked him if they could come, and he informed me that he'd prefer if they didn't as he wanted it to just be close family and friends. \n\nI told my boyfriend the situation I was in and how my friends have been telling me how upset they'll be if we don't do anything. Looking back, this was a shitty thing to say, because my friend's feelings have nothing to do with him. I realise now that I was putting pressure on my boyfriend to \"fix\" this problem by inviting two people to the party that he didn't even want there (and that we have had issues with over in the past). \n\nI very quickly recognised what was happening and I knew that I had to put my foot down and stop this behaviour. I knew that I had to tell my friends that I wasn't going to spend new years with them. \n\nAt this point I know that I've already upset my boyfriend and that I should have never mentioned the party in the first place. I should have told them immediately that I was going to spend new years with him instead of trying to orchestrate some sort of \"solution\" at the detriment of my boyfriend. \n\nI sent them a message last night explaining that I was not going to be spending new years with them. I let them know that I didn't realise that the party was only going to be close family and friends and that I felt awful for getting their hopes and then jumping ship.\n\nKnowing my friends, I know that they won't end up doing anything for new years because I have pulled out. I have messed this whole situation up so badly and upset both sides. I feel terrible. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI tried to avoid conflict with my friends by inviting them to my boyfriend's New Year's party without stopping to consider what he wanted. After finding out that he didn't want them at the party, I had ended up canceling on my friends and letting them down after getting their hopes up.",

    "text": "TIFU by confidently fixing something in my house that did not actually need fixing This morning I noticed my bathroom fan was making a weird rattling sound. I immediately assumed something was loose because the house is older and everything creaks like it’s haunted. I grabbed a screwdriver, stepped on the sink (bad idea), and started taking the cover off like I was a certified electrician who knew what I was doing.  \nAbout ten minutes into this very unnecessary operation, I took a break and at one point I was playing on rollingriches, looking up “how to clean a bathroom fan,” only to realize the rattling noise wasn’t the fan at all it was a loose plastic bottle in the cabinet below vibrating whenever someone walked by.\n\nMeaning: I dismantled a perfectly fine fan for absolutely no reason.  \nWhen I went to put everything back, I realized I had somehow turned the simple cover into a jigsaw puzzle. The screws wouldn’t line up, the frame wouldn’t sit straight, and I ended up spending 40 minutes trying to fix the thing I “fixed.”\n\nSo now my fan looks worse than before, the noise was never coming from it, and the real culprit was a $2 bottle that just needed to be moved.\n\nTL;DR Thought my bathroom fan was broken. Took it apart. Fan was fine. Noise was a loose bottle. Now the fan cover is crooked forever.",

I thought he was just being humorous but he was completely serious. Next thing I know, Im behind the counter as if I actually worked there.\n\nWithin five minutes, I managed to knock over an entire bin of metal clips. They scattered everywhere, as if they were out to get me. While I was trying to pick them up, I accidentally hit my head on the shelf so hard that everyone in the store turned to look. I attempted to play it cool, but backed up too quickly and triggered a mini avalanche of water bottles.\n\nThe owner just let out a long, weary dad-sigh and handed me a free sticker that read adventure responsibly, which felt like the politest way to say youre done from a job I never really had. I left so quickly that I swear there was cartoon dust behind me. I texted my boyfriend about the whole ordeal, and he just replied with a laughing emoji, being the supportive king he is lol.\n\ntl;dr: I pretended to help out in a gear shop, instantly created chaos, hit my head, knocked things over, and got fired from a job I didnt even have.",

    "text": "TIFU by congratulating my coworker? TIFU.... I know I did, I know ITA...but is there anything I can do to make this better? \n\nSo my coworker, K (30sF) is married with a toddler. I don't know all the details, but I know she had a crappy go of it when she was pregnant with/postpartum with her first kiddo. She was really sick, and I heard she had a couple emergency surgeries in the year after she had her baby. She's a nice lady; a little quiet and tends to keep to herself, but will smile and talk to you if you approach her. \n\nAnyways, it's been a bit of a not-so-secret-secret that she and her husband have been trying for Baby #2 for a while now. I dunno, maybe a year? This morning at work, I overheard my office-mates chatting amongst themselves, discussing how K has 'already popped' and 'they hope this time goes better for her'. I assumed I'd missed the memo, and K had announced a pregnancy! \n\nSo, when I see K standing in the hallway later, having a snack, I also see that she does definitely have what looks like a little baby bump. She's pretty tall and thin, so it's not like it was hard to notice... Wanting to be friendly and happy for her, I walk up, smile, and tell her congratulations on the new pregnancy! \n\nImagine my shock and surprise when K stares at me, tears up, and literally walks away crying without a word! A couple other coworkers witnessed this, and an older lady who is friends with K outside work pulled me aside and told me that K is actually in 'the waiting window', doesn't know if she's pregnant or not, and has been getting approached by multiple people about her stomach this week. Apparently, my congratulations were the straw that broke the camel's back?? \n\nAnyways, I know I screwed up. I shouldn't have said anything without knowing for sure. K has been avoiding everyone, staying glued to her desk and not looking up at anyone. I feel awful, but also...she literally looks pregnant?? She wasn't even hiding the bump??? It's common knowledge that she and her husband want at least one more kid???? \n\nWhat should I do? I feel bad, and want to apologize, but I also don't want to make this worse by talking to K about it more... :-(\n\nTldr; I congratulated a coworker on her 'pregnancy' without confirming she was actually pregnant. Turns out she doesn't know either, and started crying. How do I make this better?",

    "text": "TIFU by fainting at the vet's  (spoiler alert: no, I'm not a dog)\n\nToday two of my dogs had a full-on bitchfight. One ended up with a head wound that needed stitches, so off we go to the local vet dungeon a few villages down. It’s hot in there, it’s stuffy, it smells like formaldehyde and gorgonzola... it's so grimey it's like one of them escape rooms from the Saw movies. \n\nDog is beyond panicking (she's a spicy fucker).They tranquillise her with an injection but she stays in full goblin mode anyway.\n\nSo I end up helping one vet restrain her because (she was BIG MAD) while the other is stitching her and it’s basically a sweaty four-way between one sedated-but-still-feral dog, two small town Italian vets and me bent over the metal table (no such a thing as vet nurses around here, the pet owners do that job)\n\nMy stomach is mashed into the table edge (hello Vasovagal Syncope) the room is hot as bollocks and the dog won't stop whining and squirming around. \n\nThey shave and clean the area, they numb her with lidocaine and start stitching. I keep squashing myself against the table for a good 10-15 minutes under the hot lights. I stand up to change position. \n\nImmediate stars.\nImmediate tunnel vision.\nImmediate fuck my life. \n\nNext thing I know, I’m collapsing  into a metal shelf like a wet shopping bag.\n\nI come back to consciousness within seconds and the vet who was holding the dog with me is looking down at me shouting my name in Italian like a furious grandfather:\n\n“OP! CAZZO! TI HO VISTA CHE FACEVI LA SCEMA! COS’È SUCCESSO?!?”\n(Translation: “OP, FOR FUCK’S SAKE, I SAW YOU WERE BEING FUNNY, WHAT HAPPENED?!?”)\n\nMeanwhile the other vet is STILL stitching my dog with one hand while restraining her with the other and probably wondering if I'd been smoking meth.\n\nThey tell me to sit on the floor so I sort of limp / crawl  to lean against a desk because my brain has temporarily uninstalled.\n\nThen they offer me grappa (basically the Italian version of moonshine)\n\nI think it’s a joke.\nI laugh nervously.\nI’m like “haha… must be that cheeky Italian sense of humor under duress ✌🏼🙂”.\n\nNo.\n\nThey actually bring me a shot of grappa.\nAs medical care. So I take a tiny sip because hey, he's the  professional here right? Also it was already rude enough collapsing ok their filthy ass medical equipment, can't possibly say no 🥴 even tho with that I broke my 250 day sober streak 😭\n\n\nTHEN because this nightmare wasn’t absurd enough, I go to pay.\n\nThe bill is €50. The transaction is refused twice. I check my balance. I have €44 in my card, no cash. \n\nI try to bank transfer some more money from another savings account but because my brain is still operating on Windows 95 after the blackout, I fail to tick the \"instant transfer\" option (why is this even a thing?) and stand there confused as to why it’s not appearing.\n\nSo I sheepishly tell them I only have  €44 like an absolute dickhead and now I owe the vet six euros, and probably a shelf. \n\nDog is fine.\nMy back hurts.\nThe vet thinks fainting = lack of \"courage\" so basically called me a wimp 😤\n\nOh, also, they waved me goodbye as I had to drive home alone through dark twisty mountain roads with my fucked up back and even more fucked up dog. \n\nTL;DR: \nDog got stitches. I helped hold it down at a hot, stuffy vet, fainted, banged my back. Vet shouted at me, offered me liquor to recover from fainting. I accepted the liquor therefore breaking my 9 month sober streak. Bill €50, had €44, now owe €6. FML.",

It's not horrible, but it's definitely a hairline that's an inch or so higher up than it should be. Not a LeBron James level hairline, but it's not normal either. Luckily he only has a week left of school before winter break, but I'm hoping it's not so bad where anyone at school makes fun of him about it because that's obviously not his fault. I'm just hoping so badly it grows back quick and covers up/fills in the forehead where it doesn't look too bad.\n\nIt sucks too because he was enjoying me cutting his hair for a change because I know how to use the cutter and it didn't hurt him and he wasn't scared and he was having fun, but I think it's safe to say I won't be trusted to ever do this again. Obviously it's a mistake but I feel so horrible over this, and of course all family members are pissed at me even though it's 95% fine minus that hairline and its not a mistake I'll make again. I'm sure we can all laugh about it...once the current hair grows back, but the weeks until then....\n\nIf I mess up on something that just impacts me I'm fine with because it's on me, but messing up on something that impacts someone else, and in this case a physical appearance, even if it's only temporary, I feel so awful over right now.\n\nTL;DR: Cut my nephews hair for the first time and I messed up his forehead/hairline where it's an inch or two higher up/shorter than it should be",

Here we go.\n\nI was on one of those city buses that has that sudden *jerk-stop-then-yeet-forward* routine every few blocks. Since all the seats were taken, I was standing with my backpack slung over one shoulder, trying to look casual while checking the route on my phone.\n\nThe bus lurched, my backpack slid, and my whole center of gravity basically said, \"Good luck, girl.\" I stumbled forward, attempted to catch myself on one of those metal poles missed and ended up accidentally grabbing this poor guys ARM instead.

    "text": "TIFU by confidently assuming I could fix a “minor clog” I woke up this morning feeling way too good about myself for a Monday, which should’ve been the first warning sign. Look, the sink in my bathroom had been draining slowly for a few days, and instead of doing the sensible thing and calling maintenance, I decided to take it on myself. I watched one YouTube video - literally one - and immediately thought I was some kind of plumbing prodigy. Spoiler: I was not. I took the U‑bend off, fully expecting a clump of hair or something equally unpleasant. What I did NOT expect was for the pipe to basically burp out what I can only describe as primordial goo. It splattered all over the vanity, my shirt, and somehow the ceiling. I mean, I jerked back so hard I hit my elbow on the towel rack, which made me drop the U‑bend, which then rolled under the cabinet. I scrambled to grab it, knocked over the cleaning supplies, and managed to hit the open bottle of Drano, which then started slowly spreading across the floor like a chemical crime scene. In a panic, I tried to “temporarily” reattach the U‑bend while the sink was still open and dripping. I didn’t tighten it enough, so when I tested the water, it blasted out like a tiny busted fire hydrant, soaking the underside of the cabinet and every roll of toilet paper I owned. At this point my bathroom smelled like sewer soup and wet cardboard. That’s when maintenance knocked - turns out the downstairs neighbor had already reported water dripping from their ceiling. So now I’m standing there covered in mystery sludge, my sink is somehow worse than before, and the maintenance guy gives me the most defeated “why would you do this” look I’ve ever seen in my life. I just muttered something about “DIY confidence” and accepted my fate. TL;DR Tried to fix a slow drain with YouTube-level plumbing skills, unleashed bathroom chaos, soaked everything, and caused a leak into my neighbor’s apartment.",

    "text": "TIFU by accidentally turning something innocent into potential sexual harassment Just 5 hours ago, I went to a mall to buy a bottle of silicone lubricant for my ROKR Marble Squad mechanical model. **Important detail, it's made of wood**. \n\nSince I lost the silicone stick that comes with the box, my only option was to get a WD-40 silicone spray.\n\nSo I searched for a cheaper alternative used for skin care and went to a physical store to avoid shipping fee. It was located at the beauty section within the department store. The receptionist in the area was a young lady just doing her work.\n\nSo I walked up and asked her where could I find some silicone lubricant. Went to the Isle that she pointed me to.

Here's the dialogue:\n\n\n\nMe: \"For the record, this is not for me.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Don't worry, I'm not going to judge.\"\n\nMe: \"No I'm just kidding, it's actually for a piece of wood.\" Get it?

I would probably avoid the store for the foreseeable future.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Went to buy some Silicone Lubricant for my toy model in a beauty shop because I'm a cheapskate. Ended up making inappropriate sexual joke to the receptionist, as the innuendoes flew over my head. Big Surprise!

I took out the “pillow,” unpacked the nice stuff… and when I broke down the box for recycling, I tossed the pillow in the garbage.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, garbage day. My downstairs roommate was being nice and took the bins out to the alley for pickup. Around noon I start getting frantic texts from my girlfriend asking if I threw out the pillowcase and if the garbage had been picked up yet.\n\nThen she tells me the “pillow” was actually a custom Christmas tree skirt my grandma made for me about 5 years ago. She’d been holding onto it, waiting until I was in a more stable place before giving it to me. She put well over 100 hours into making it.\n\nThen my mom calls me crying, telling me how long my grandma had saved it for me, how much work went into it, and basically how bad I fucked up (as if I didn't already know). \n\nI got off the phone with her and frantically called the city to see if the dump truck had unloaded yet. End up talking to waste disposal manager for the city who tells me to meet the truck inside the dump so I can try and find it. Luckily the dump truck driver had stopped to buy a lottery ticket, so dispatch had time to tell him to hold off on dumping his load.\n\nI drove straight to the dump, met up with the driver, and started digging through garbage. I ended up digging through trash for well over an hour looking for it. Had like 4 other city employees helping me look.\n\nBut I actually found it.\n\nI was so relieved that genuinely cried a bit in front of a bunch of garbage men. The pillow case seems to have protected it well as it still just smells like my grandparents wood burning stove. Not a single stain or anything else that shows the journey it's been through.\n\nFor some added context, in the last 6 years I've really turned my life around. Got out of a bad relationship, quit vaping and weed, went to college, got a career and just bought a house 2 months ago. And with my new house, I'm hosting Christmas for the first time. Basically I used to let the people around me down alot and I really didn't want to do that again. \n\nI still feel so guilty about throwing it out in the first place. With the time she put in making it and how she was saving it till I was in a more stable position, how much of a slap in the face it would have been to lose it like that. Very thankful it all worked out\n\nTLDR: Threw out a lumpy \"Pillow\" that was actually a custom tree skirt my grandmother spent 100 hours making. Dug through the landfill to find it",

    "text": "TIFU by picking my belly button Lemme start off by saying that I'm a pretty hygienic fella - I shower at least once a day, and after the gym as well, so I average more than 7 showers a week. I deodorize, and take care of myself. Which is what makes this TIFU so strange, or so I thought.\n\nI was on a work call last month, not paying attention and scratching various body parts to alleviate the boredom when I began picking navel fluff. After about a minute I felt a decent piece of lint that felt harder than the rest, so I gave it a pull, and it actually hurt coming out. It was a piece of dry skin or scab that I had just pulled off. I didn't think much of it and went along the rest of the day.\n\nThe following day, as I was getting undressed before showering, I noticed a red stain on my shirt. My belly button had been bleeding.\n\nThen the day after that, after my gym workout, my shirt was wet in the same spot, wetter than the first day, but not blood. It went like that for a few days, and then I woke up with a stinging sensation in my stomach/belly button area. At this point I went to the doctor (Hooray for public healthcare!), who took a look, and then prescribed me some pretty strong antibiotics. Turns out the navel is NOT a clean place, and by picking off that slab of dead skin or whatever it was, and then continuing my day, running, sweating, and all that, I had managed to get it infected. \n\nFor all my claims about cleanliness, apparently I never actually cleaned my belly button properly (raise your hand if you've ever actually dedicated any time in the shower to your belly button, don't make me be the only idiot here). And so I had to take 14 days of a pretty strong antibiotic with no drinking, so I got to be designated driver on my wife and I's group friends date night while everybody else drank. \n\nSmall fries in the larger scale of things, but bummer nonetheless.\n\ntl:dr - picked my belly button, gave myself a nasty navel infection, no alcohol for 2 weeks on the one night I get to go out with the wife and friends while the kids are asleep.\n\n(Disclaimer: English is not my first language. I did NOT use AI to write or rewrite this. All idiosyncrasies are mine and mine alone)",

You know, something thoughtful and romantic, right? So I decided to make a homemade pasta with a creamy sauce, garlic bread, and a fresh salad. Simple, but elegant.\n\nI spent hours in the kitchen, trying to follow the recipe, checking the ingredients over and over to make sure I wasnt missing anything. Everything seemed to be going great until I tried to fry the chicken for the pasta. I guess I got distracted by the sound of a movie playing in the background and... forgot the oil was getting too hot. You can guess what happened next. The chicken burned. Badly. I didnt want to ruin the whole thing, so I threw more oil in the pan to try and salvage it, but it just got worse.\n\nAt this point, I could smell smoke, and I looked around to see that a few paper towels had caught fire. Of course they had. I grabbed the first thing I could findmy dish toweland tried to swat out the flames, only to knock it into the frying pan, making everything worse. The smoke was so bad the entire apartment started filling up, and before I could even process it, the fire alarm started going off.\n\nI was frantically waving my arms, trying to turn off the alarm, but it only made it louder. Meanwhile, shes standing there, wide-eyed, not sure whether to laugh or be worried. I dont blame her.\n\nLong story short, we ended up eating frozen pizza and laughing at how much of a disaster my \"romantic\" dinner was. And as for the chicken and garlic bread? Well... let's just say I wont be cooking for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my date with a home-cooked dinner, caught my kitchen on fire, set off the fire alarm, and ended up ordering pizza instead.",

You know, the classic Zoom mullet: business on top, sleepover on the bottom.\n\nI tested my camera beforehand, everything looked fine shoulders up, very CEO. I even practiced my I’m paying attention face.\n\nThe meeting starts, and surprisingly, I’m doing great.

So I got myself an ice cream sandwich and chow down on it. After I finished it I saw a friend and went to talk to them. So while I'm talking with them my partner comes over and is looking at me. Once I notice them, they say something and then make a motion with their finger on their face to tell me I have something on my face. It's a little hard to hear since there's karaoke happening. Now I know I'm a messy eater and often get food on my face, so while I didn't process what they said yet I just took the indicator that it was near my upper lip and assumed it was from the ice cream sandwich. Thinking it's just food I go to lick it and that's when it's too late. My tongue is already in motion and there's no stopping once I realize what my partner said. \"There's an insect on your face,\" and in that moment my tongue hits the bug. Now I didn't eat cause I immediately do spitting action to blow it off my tongue sending it flying to it's certain death. So now I'm standing there looking at my partner and friend's horrified faces as they think I intentionally went to eat the bug. Trying to make things better I just say, \"I killed it.\" They were not pleased with that. They start questioning why would I lick it and I tried to explain I didn't think it was a bug. My partner, who hates all bugs, wouldn't let me kiss them until I cleaned my mouth. Honestly found it funny how much more they reacted than I did.\n\nTLDR; I licked a bug off my face thinking it was going to be ice cream. My partner was not happy.",

This happened about 45 minutes ago and I am currently eating my Pad Thai in the dark because I am too ashamed to look at the windows.\nFor context, I (23F) had a brutally long day at work. I came home, ordered my favorite comfort food, and decided to hop in the shower while waiting. The app said the driver was 20 minutes away, so I figured I had plenty of time to scrub off the day and get into pajamas before he arrived.\nI was wrong. I was mid-conditioner when my phone started buzzing on the counter. \"Driver is approaching.\" Panic mode engaged.\nI rinsed off in record time, jumped out, and realized I hadn't brought fresh clothes into the bathroom. I heard the knock on the front door. I didn't want to make him wait, so I grabbed my large bath towel and did the classic \"tuck and roll\" maneuver. I looked in the mirror and thought, \"Okay, this is secure. I’ll just wrap the towel tight, grab the bag, and close the door. 5 seconds max.\"\nI marched to the door with unearned confidence. I opened it, and there he was. He was a older guy, maybe 30-40, which made this infinitely worse.\nI smiled, said \"Hi!\", and reached out my right arm to grab the heavy bag of food.\nPhysics was not on my side today. I guess lifting my arm created some sort of structural failure in the towel knot. It didn't fall completely to the floor, but the top corner (the crucial part covering my chest) just... gave up. It flopped completely down.\nI wasn't wearing anything underneath.\nTime froze. He saw. I saw him see. My nipples were definitely making an appearance. I frantically used my other hand to slap the towel back up against my chest, but the damage was done.\nHe didn't even blink. He just stared for a split second, handed me the bag, and said \"Enjoy your meal\" in a super low, strained voice. He practically sprinted back to his Honda Civic.\nI locked the door and slid down to the floor. I immediately opened the app and tipped him $15 on a $20 order out of pure guilt and hush money.\nSo, to the driver if you see this: I am so sorry. Please enjoy the tip, and please don't report me for harassment 😂\n\nTL;DR: Tried to answer the door in a towel to get my dinner. Reached for the food and the towel knot betrayed me. Flashed the poor delivery driver, who ran away in terror. I paid a $15 \"please forget my boobs\" tax.",

So to procrastinate, I twiddled my thumbs in the dinner room with some of my family, I mention that I’m craving chocolate (I’m on my period booo) and my little brother says we have half a bag of chocolate chips. Perfect, I have an excuse to do something that looks productive and I get sweets out of it. \nI get to baking, I’ve done chocolate chip cookies enough to know what I’m doing. But when I get to adding butter horror strikes as I used calcium butter and it makes the dough extremely sticky. To remedy this I added a butt load of flour, the dough was still a little sticky but good enough. I pop them into the oven and 10 minutes later out comes some really puffy cookies, bland but not bad. \nNow this is where I fucked up, I was talking about how I messed up the cookies with my dad and mentioned how I used “bad butter” (like it wasn’t right for this kind of thing) this set something off because he started to accuse me of not taking responsibility and not holding myself accountable by putting the blame on the butter. He proceeded to say “this is what’s wrong with America!” (???????) he’s been watching a lot more conservative/red pilled media and I think this related to that (?). \nI’m confused at this point and start to shut down (a bad habit of my when it comes to conflict) I tell him it’s not me deflecting my mistake just pointing out where I went wrong. He throws the cookie he was eating on the ground and says he doesn’t want it anymore and that I should throw the rest away (when I move to do that he stops me, so I don’t think he was being serious.) he tells me that I should prove that it’s the butter, so I can see for myself what went wrong and insists that we go to the store right now and buy more. I refuse since I didn’t want to do that and the whole point of making the cookies was to use the last of the chocolate chips. \nHe went to talk to my mother about going to the store I didn’t really hear what he said as I was getting ready to shovel the driveway. When he came back and I once again refused to go (reiterating my previous point and saying I had other things to do-like shovel the drive way) he interrupted me mid sentence and told me to “stop talking, don’t talk to me the rest of the day….your a disappointment”\nNow never have I ever heard him call me that, especially over cookies. At that point I had no idea how to react. I just stood there as he walked away, I could feel tears well in my eyes but I just couldn’t care I felt so tired that I took a moment and then went out to shovel. The cherry on top that literally less than 30 minutes ago he was hugging me and telling me how much he loved and how he’d take a butllet for me lol. \n\nTL;DR: I used the wrong butter when making cookies, I mentioned this to my dad (referring to it as “bad butter”) he took this as me not taking responsibility for my mistakes. When I refused to go to the store to buy more butter to test this he called me a disappointment.",

    "text": "TIFU while making a tuna salad So yesterday I decided to make my favorite tuna salad for lunch. It's delicious, tasty, awesome. Music is playing in the background, my mind is wandering, I'm in a good mood. I sat down to eat, and the salad tasted very strange. I ate three forkfuls and thought, no, I need to go and check if something is wrong with the ingredients. The salad leaves are fine, the cucumbers too, the tuna is still good, the capers are fresh... okay, maybe my tastebuds are a bit off, happens. Continued eating, it’s still weird. Then I go to take a double look and see that the can of tuna is actually a can of cat food. I used a cat food in my salad, and gave the actual tuna to my cats for breakfast. No shit they were so eager to get more food this morning, they had a day of their life.\n\nI brushed my teeth 4 times and could still feel the cat food, which was met with a good old diarhea a few hours later.\n\nTL;DR I used cat food instead of tuna for my tuna salad and got diarhea later :))",

    "text": "TIFU - Just had a job interview, and the interviewer is good friends with my current boss. How screwed am I? As the title says\n\nI just interviewed for a local company for a marketing position.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview he says “Oh so I see you work for “X” company! So you work for [boss/owners name] - her and I go way back she’s a good friend of mine we used to do work for (yadda yadda etc). She’s quite the difficult personality to get along with and a lot of people find her challenging to work for”\n\nHe kept talking about her a lot and one of his questions to me was\n\n“If I were to run into (so-and-so) and ask about you what do you think she’d say?”\n\nFuck!!!\n\nI answered the question but I was thinking in my head how do I say “please dont” without sounding like a jerk? It’s too late now because I wasn’t able to gather the courage to say please dont speak to my boss and I never did it and now I’m kicking myself\n\nI am scared she will catch wind that i am interviewing and fire me or something or speak to me about it. She is the type of person that takes it very personal when her employees seek other jobs.\n\nHow screwed am I?\n\nI am mentally preparing and accepting my fate well if I lose my job I’ll just be collecting unemployment for awhile. But the industry I am in is absolute garbage in the sense that very rarely does a position pop up for availability and it’s highly competitive.\n\nAlso I do not want to work for the place I just interviewed for as well because a lot of red flags came up in the conversation that my gut is telling me to avoid. I am planning on declining a second interview if they reach out. It’s a farther commute and not hybrid remote versus my current job which is closer and hybrid. But what piqued my interest was the salary increase and health/pto benefits and also the position was something I want to move toward career-wise. Just the company culture itself screamed red flag nightmare to me but that’s a whole other essay I could write about so I’ll spare the details. Long story short - not a good fit for me or my career goals.\n\nTLDR: Fucked up because interviewer implied that he will be asking my boss about me since he’s good friends with her. I did not have the guts to say “please dont” and am now kicking myself. I dont even want this job either after red flags in the interview conversation.",

TL;DR i didn’t go to my wife’s cousins funeral because i don’t go into churches and now my wife and her family is mad at me",

    "text": "TIFU By Telling My Friends Cousin She Isn't Cherokee and Cursing Let me start off by saying that I myself am not Cherokee but I am of another Tribe and a little Columbian. I dislike it when anyone brings up blood quantum and don't think it's an indicator of one's right to their heritage.\\\nI'm me (20M), my friend: Able (21M), and his cousin: Cassidy (mid 20F). All fake names.\n\nCassidy has been saying she's Cherokee for a few years but her family tells her that they don't know for sure.\\\nHer mom's parents are from Ireland and somewhere near Germany while her dad's parents are from New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nHer maternal grandparents often like to share their stories growing up and how much has changed since they moved to the US but most don't listen to them.\n\nHer paternal grandparents said they often moved from state to state with their kids but eventually settled after one of them got sick with something.\nHer dad hasn't liked me ever since I met them and rarely talks to me, so I mainly keep my distance and try not to interact with him.\n\nI mainly noticed she says she's Cherokee when I'm near her and didn't think too much of it since I've met a lot of Cherokee, but she usually wears other tribes patterns and jewelry.\\\nI once asked her about one of her jewelry pieces since it looked Sioux and I've only met 3, she said she bought it at a store because it called out to her.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I took half the day off from cleaning a house to meet up with Able to see if he'd be available to join me for a holiday party one of his honorary uncles was throwing since they rarely get to see each other as much and because I probably wouldn't know anyone else at the party.\n\nHe agreed and we planned out a schedule but Cassidy and her parents walked in and she asked why I was invited.\\\nI explained to her why and she had a disgusted look on her face and the conversation went something like this:\n\nC: You're (Tribe Name) and not Christian or catholic, why are you celebrating Christmas? You already had Thanksgiving to celebrate.\\\nA: You're right, but he's family to us. You already know the Thanksgiving stories, why are acting like it never happened?\\\nMe: Your family usually invites me, why is this different?\\\nC: Because we're both native and our uncle probably just wants to flaunt him to everyone at the party, he's gone crazy since his wife passed.\\\nA: His kids will be there, he loved his wife, and our family keeps saying we aren't sure we're Cherokee, have you been enrolled or anything?\nC: No, you don't even need to be 'enrolled' to be Cherokee, they take anyone. Why do you think so many say they are Cherokee?\"\nMe: You need a Tribal ID Card, like mine.\n\nI show her my card and she looked confused since she's mainly heard others call me by my nickname 'shorty' since I'm 5'1 and most can't pronounce it.\\\nShe called her mom over since her dad went outside with other family members and her mom just said \"Everyone is a little Cherokee, they were civilized with the other 4 Tribes, unlike those other savages tribes.\"\n\nAble and I were too stunned to say anything back to either of them, I asked if we can go to his room to not say anything we might regret when Cassidy spoke up.\n\nC: Why are you acting like you didn't know? It's not my fault my Tribe followed the Europeans.\nA: Just drop it and leave us alone.\nC: Why are you two acting weird? Were you replaced by sk*nw*lk*rs or something?\n\nI lost it and unmasked and said something I regret or at least wish I didn't say out loud to her face.\n\nMe: Shut the fuck up already, that isn't even similar to a shapeshifter you dumb and sad excuse for a person.\\\nEven if you were Cherokee, you would know that isn't even yours! It's mine and my culture, you fucking whites took everything from us, our land, our women, our cousins, and now our culture?! Fuck off!\n\nI grabbed Able to go to his went to his room so can I took a cold bath to cool off and let some tears out as we talked.\\\nI heard Cassidy's mom yell at us to get back and apologize to her daughter, some of the family came inside to see what the yelling was about.\n\nAble's dad knocked at the door and asked to speak to us, Able let him in and we talked while I wiped my tears, dried off and got dressed.\\\nWe told him what happened and took our side, he apologized profusely and said he had some responsibility for inviting them.\n\nAble and I left to the park and heard his dad chew them out and kicked them out, most of their family is on our side but few of them agree with Cassidy.\\\nI try to mask most of myself but today was one of the day I couldn't hold it anymore.\n\nAm I wrong for reacting the way I did?\n\nTL;DR: I got mad and cursed at my friends cousin for acting like she's Cherokee and using my culture without care for it or other Tribes. She also doesn't think I should celebrate the holidays since I'm not religious like them.",

    "text": "TIFU by probably ruining a family’s Christmas Over the weekend I was a volunteer ticket-taker at a theater. Mostly we were there to make sure patrons had the right date and time and direct them to the left or right entrance based on their reserved seat number. \n\nA woman came in with her three kids and showed me the tickets on her phone. Now, the clientele at this theater tend to be pretty put together - kids are in their Sunday/Xmas best and whatnot. This woman was completely disheveled and had pretty crazy energy swirling about her. The kids looked like they had just rolled out of bed and thrown on their one holiday outfit, which was probably not purchased new at a nice store, if you catch my drift. \n\nSo she shows me the tickets - the date was right, the time was right… but the venue was on the other side of the county. She went to the wrong place. Apparently this was a known problem where the other place’s website was directing customers to us. But no one told me this when I showed up to volunteer. \n\nI explained to her that she was at the wrong venue and showed her on the map where she was supposed to be. But there was basically no way to get there before their performance would start. She basically grabbed the kids and ran out before I could think of a better solution. For the record, the obvious solution was to direct her to one of the actual company employees, who (I found out later) probably would have just given her tickets since she was already there and that particular show hadn’t sold out. \n\nI feel terrible. Judging by appearances, the tickets were probably a significant splurge so she could do one nice thing for the kids this season and while I wasn’t responsible for the initial error my inability to think quickly in the moment meant no Nutcracker for them, and that’s weighing really heavily on me. \n\nTl:dr- turned away someone for having wrong tickets and probably ruined the family’s Christmas, when there was a workable solution available",

I have a friend (who I only really get to see a couple of times a year in person- due to scheduling children and adult life) who I wouldn’t be able to see before Christmas to post her card- I handmake them. \n\nSo I sent a message asking for her address, as I didn’t know it off the top of my head- I know it’s in Worcester somewhere. \n\nI have another woman saved in my WhatsApp with the same name, from my previous job. I hardly ever messaged her, other than to get shifts swapped between us as we are both mom’s to littles. \n\nDidn’t dislike the woman, but she’s not someone I fondly miss from the place. I don’t even know why her number was still in my phone?! \n\nAnyway, I messaged who I thought was my friend, but it was this woman I used to work with. I didn’t even look at the picture on WhatsApp to see that it was obviously not my friend. \n\nShe sent me a message saying, “I’ve had a new phone who is this?” That old chestnut hey?\n\nI forgot I changed my WhatsApp pic to Jeff Goldblum- so I’m sending her a voice note with a picture of Jeff Goldblum on it like, “oh how rude (in a cheery tone). It’s (my name). Yes I realise now it’s actually a picture of the fabulous Jeff Goldblum, so I’m sending a voice note to say it’s still me. Send me your address anyway bitch, so I can send your Christmas card”. \n\nShe responded with her address and a laugh emoji. As we both live in Wolverhampton, the address said WV rather than WR for Worcester. \n\nTook me a second before I went, “wait a minute…who have I just messaged?” \n\nI felt so embarrassed that I just messaged back, “lovely I’ll pop it in the post today”. It’s too far gone now to turn back, it’s already in the post box. I can never go back to that place of work on my down time now- they’re going to think I’m off my head. \n\nI can honestly say I’m an overworked single mom, trying to get Christmas magic organised amongst daily living, sending gifts and cards to friends and family, whilst trying to work.

    "text": "TIFU, by forgetting to add coins..(well it happens in 1984) My last post here some 9 years ago kinda blew up. It has been published in 3 books and even adapter to a tv/web episode.. so I thought I would tell you about a thing that happened the year before I foolishly got my appendix removed in GDR because I did not have the balls to admit that I was hung over.. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/NCXilPaqcV\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so sorry for any errors.\n\nI was going to High School in a small town in Western New York, and were visiting my mothers aunt in Brooklyn. I am Norwegian by the way and was an AFS student at the time.\n\nTimes Square in 1984 was not what it is today. It was filled with porn theaters, recruiters for the U.S. Army, hustlers selling watches from open suitcases. Steam rose from grates. Costumed men handed out flyers. The Naked Cowboy, I think or it might be a false memory and mixed with later visits to New York, in just a hat, stars-and-stripes briefs, and a guitar, stood there. Manic eyes fixed on the crowd. Hormones drove me up 42nd Street, into a cinema. The floor was sticky with spilled soda. I stumbled into the screening of the movie Phantasm, a silver ball drilling itself into a man’s forehead on the screen. Not what I wanted. I wandered into another theater, lined with dark booths. I exchanged bills for quarters, slipped into a cubicle. The seat was sticky, the walls streaked white with old stains. I tried not to think too hard about them. A screen flickered on when I inserted a coin  and I saw John Holmes, Seka, Ron Jeremy. I didn’t dare do what others did. I left quickly. Further down the street was a peep show. Inside the building a circular platform. Women behind plexiglass, dancing. I paid through a slot. A Black woman stripped for me, laughing, teasing. “Do your thing, honey,” she said. I hesitated. She laughed harder. “Drop your pants, boy. Slap your monkey. Strangle your snake.” Her words hit me like a command. I obeyed. Awkwardly, trembling, I lowered my pants and began to touch myself. She spread herself for me, her purple lips pulled apart to reveal tender pink. My eyes were wide, my heart pounding. I climaxed quickly, clumsily, like the boy I was. And then the door swung open. I had forgotten to feed more quarters into the machine. I stood frozen, pants at my ankles, semen dripping, exposed to the entire crowd outside. Laughter exploded, cruel and roaring. Faces tilted back, mouths open. The girl behind the glass doubled over, laughing at me too. I pulled my pants up, stumbled, tripped on the baggy legs, and fell face-first. My torso landed across the threshold of the booth, into something cold and sticky. I didn’t need to guess what it was. The smell told me enough. My clothes were smeared with other men’s seed. Desperate, humiliated, I scrambled up. More laughter. Pointing fingers. My face burned. I wanted the floor to swallow me. Then, through the chaos, a heavyset Black woman appeared. She pulled me away, into a small side room lit only by a red bulb. She wiped me down with wet towels. Then she smiled and told me to go home. I left in a daze. The smell of that place stayed with me. Salt and sweat, perfume and filth. The sticky booths, the narrow-eyed girls, the men who shuffled between cubicles with buckets and rags. And the laughter, the fucking endless, echoing laughter. I never wanted to experience it again\n\nTL;DR I forgot to put enough coins in to a peep show cabin and ended up stumbling on my own pants and falling on loads of other men’s sperm… Edit: a number and a link",

    "text": "TIFU by misunderstanding who brings the Christmas presents This is a story from my childhood, so it's not from today.\n\nFor context: in Poland, depending on the region, Christmas presents are brought by different people. I grew up in the part where Santa Claus brings gifts on St. Nicholas Day (December 6), and on Christmas Day we have dressed in a sheepskin coat and a red mask guy named Starman (Gwiazdor).\n\nWhen I was maybe 6 years old, I remember how in December everyone asked me what I wanted from Santa and what I wanted from Starman. Since I had seen Santa on TV more than once, I knew who to expect, but since Starman had never been featured in any movie, I had no idea what he looked like.\n\nSo how did my six-year-old brain explain who Starman was? It decided that since he was some kind of famous star, he must be... Elvis Presley, the rock star.\n\nTo this day, I remember imagining a fat Elvis in a white leather outfit with sequins leaving presents under the Christmas tree and instead of \"Ho, ho, ho,\" he said his iconic \"Aha, aha, aha.\"\n\nThis lasted for several years, until I stopped believing in Santa. I told my sister about it, and now she reminds me of this funny story every Christmas.\n\nTL;DR: I believed that Elvis was giving Christmas presents to children in Poland.",

    "text": "TIFU by not watching my candle on my candle warmer while playing Animal Crossing I recently got a candle warmer at Walmart. It looks like a lamp where you turn it on, have a candle in the middle, and it burns the candle without needing to light a match. It’s bee wonderful to have as my candles are near a lot of technology and really need to be watched at all times if they are lit. \n\nToday, I put a candle on there that I have had for a while. It’s a long blue candle that isn’t a glass container. With that, I had been watching it as I saw the wax melt inside, and noticed the outside was melting a bit too, but not as quickly as the inside (or so I thought)\n\nI decided to turn my attention to Animal Crossing as I recently had a villager move out and was getting the next place ready for my next villager (I like to give my villagers flowers and fences that match the villager moving into the house). \n\nI probably was paying attention to my game for probably about 15-20 minutes when I looked over where my candle warmer is and realized there’s some weird liquid on my desk. To my horror, I realized my candle was melting more and had spilled everywhere on my desk. I turned it off immediately and tried to stop the candle liquid from dripping off my desk. I was thankfully able to stop the majority of it from dripping on the ground. \n\nSo lesson learned: watch your candles no matter what,even if they’re not burning. Especially if the candle doesn’t have a container for the wax to melt inside \n\nTL;DR: I wasn’t watching my candle while it was on a candle warmer to play Animal Crossing and it melted everywhere",

    "text": "TIFU by switching my boss's coffee? .Two weeks ago my boss (43m) sent me (27m) an email which I found out later he sent to the rest of the office. He made us aware that the coffee brand the company buys us is no longer being provided. We all got quite enraged as the brand we are given isn't even expensive (around $6 per 100g) we are not a big company with about 15 staff total. We have each tried to make attempts to persuade him against it but he really won't budge.\n\nAfter a week with a completely coffee-less staff thing started to get tense, many pointed out that this simple purchase made the office staff feel more like a joint team in a way. but no matter what we said he wouldn't budge on his stance. Me and my roommate (28m) who we will call mathew, decided it was time to be petty.\n\nFor some background our boss drinks EXPENSIVE coffee and has never let anyone taste it before. I've found out it's about 100ish nz dollars 57ish USD for his instant coffee(he buys it online). He constantly raves about his \"perfectly smooth instant coffee” and we all have become sick of it. Me and Mathew went to the supermarket and brought a tub of what we'd normally be provided and waited for my next shift. Our shift starts don't line up so it was all on me to complete what we called the great coffee hist. \n\nOn Monday I came into work 20 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive and snuck into his office and switched the coffee. It was a fresh container. By the looks of it he had only had one drink. I switched the coffee powder labels between the containers, so he believed that i had brought in my own one from home but really i took his… this only worked because he would top our coffee up in one of his old containers because it came in a bag.\n\nLater that morning i went in to conveniently chat to him to see how the coffee was treating him and it turns out HE LOVED IT. He told me that he didn't know what happened, but it got better overnight!! I had to practically run out of there to stop myself from laughing in his face.\n\nI found Matthew to tell him what happened and him and the other colleagues around were dubbed over in laughter. But some kept calling me a jerk. This lead me to think that i may have made a grave mistake.\n\nTL;DR: today i made a mistake by switching my bosses coffee",

Staying at a pretty nice, but unremarkable hotel (based on my hotel experience, which is minimal to this point in life apart from this tour.)\n\nI had some dirty dishes building up; congealed coffee and day-old chicken scraps, and figured I should do some dishes washing. Crap goes in sink, plug in, detergent in, hot water on, wait. \n\nPhone rings. It's my partner, so I grab my headphones, do a little bit of faffing getting them to talk to the phone, plug my phone in, and we start chatting. I completely forget about the sink. For like 20 minutes. \n\nAt one point the call dropped out, and I took my headphones off... And that's when I heard/realised. \n\nFuuuuuck. Fuck. The tiles are 2cm deep under water, it's saturated the carpet. I get busy mopping up with towels and wringing them out in the sink, and the downstairs neighbour knocks on my door, it's running through into their room too. \n\nFuuuuuck &gt;&lt;\n\nHotel owner was really good about it, got a dehumidifier going and some fresh towels, and told me not to worry - while also mentioning that the carpet downstairs is only a few months old and cost a packet to install. \n\nFast forward to this morning and my rooms carpet is fine, but downstairs has to be replaced. It'll be an insurance job, but it's still getting charged out to the company I work for... Something tells me that this is gonna be the last time I work for them.\n\nTL;DR: forgot I was filling the sink in my hotel room. Flooded my room and the room below me, costing the company I work for a tonne of money &amp; making me feel like a right idiot.",

    "text": "TIFU by buying \"salt\" Technically not TIFU, but today I finally figured it out.\n\nIt was a normal afternoon about a week ago and I had nearly run out of salt at home. After my class for my Masters ended, I went for my usual shopping trip at the nearby grocery store. I was about to check out when I remembered I had to buy the salt - I knew the bus was coming soon so I took a quick look, grabbed the cheapest product with a label containing the English word \"salt\" which looked exactly like salt, and paid for my groceries. I'm a native English speaker living in a Nordic country and my knowledge of the local language isn't amazing, but I knew the word for salt was the same and was pretty sure I had what I needed.\n\nFast forward a week and my old container of salt has completely run out, so I use the new one to make my usual dish of vegan mashed potatoes and greens (with oil instead of butter, it tastes incredible). A minute or so after I finished sprinkling it, I smelled a very strange smell and felt a sensation in my nose that can only be described as a worse version of the \"water up the nose\" feeling. I ate a bite and threw away the rest, worrying that the food might somehow be spoiled or that I maybe forgot to wash some detergent off the pan or the ladle. I also noticed that it didn't taste very salty, but I figured I might just have not used enough salt and I'm used to using much less salt in my food anyway.\n\nThe day after, I heated up some pre-seasoned potatoes which I consumed without incident, and today, two days after that, I used the same \"salt\" to season some frozen French fries. As you might guess by now, I had the same reaction. This was getting a bit too weird for me to process on my own at home, so I called my mom and told her I was worried I might be having some kind of reaction to potatoes (my brain initially forgot the normality of the pre-seasoned potatoes entirely). Step by step, I started to put things together and realized that it must have been one of the spices I was using, and the only spice I hadn't put in my food before this mess started was the \"salt\".\n\nAfter searching reputable sources to see if any type of salt might cause what I experienced, I started to worry that what I had bought wasn't salt at all. After Google Translate failed to help, I finally used Wikipedia to find out I was right. When I bought it, I had noticed that the label read something like \"heart salt\" in English; it turned out that rather than sodium chloride, I had bought...ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent used in many baking products which can irritate the nose. I was aware of the compound but not of its old name, \"salt of Hartshorn\", from which the name still used in many Nordic countries derives.  \n\nTomorrow I'm going to go and buy some real salt so that I can enjoy the taste of the food I make again...\n\nTL;DR: bought what I thought was salt but was very much not salt due to a misunderstood translation.",

We talked about a lot of things, from relationships to sex to boys. So when the new Fifty Shades of Grey movie came out in theaters, we decided we wanted to go together, since we watched the previous ones together. \n\nSo the day it dropped my mom picked me up from school and we headed towards the cinema. We bought snacks and drinks and waited in line for the movie to start. \n\nWe get inside the cinema and make our way to our assigned seats. There were already about 5 people sitting in the seats next to ours… Want to take a wild guess who? Well…If you said 5 of my teachers that I personally know… you would be correct. They knew me, they knew my mom. And we were about to sit next to them. I was MORTIFIED.\n\nMy mom actually sat down and started talking to them about my CLASSES!!! I wanted to crawl into a hole. \n\nYou think that is awkward, so did I. Until…the sex scenes started playing on screen and my teachers were sitting right next to me. \n\nTheir classes were never the same again.\n\nI think about this every now and again and get mortified all over again. Sorry for any errors, English is not my first language. This is also my first reddit post.\n\nTLDR: I sat next to my teachers while watching Fifty Shades Darker…",

I was still driving and didn't want to respond from my phone since I was running late and incorrectly thought my boss would know I was responding back from my Iphone and I was still TWENTY minutes away from my apartment.\n\nA few minutes goes by then she sends me a video chat.

Everything started perfectly: good vibes, fun conversation, and plenty of laughs. But about an hour in, my stomach decided to declare war on me.

I tried so hard to stay classy, keep my composure, and make it seem like nothing was wrong.\n\nAt first, I thought I was pulling it off flawlessly… until at the end of the night, she gave me a weird knowing smile and mentioned that she had noticed I was disappearing a lot.

    "text": "TIFU by getting my friends hopes up about a New Year's party and then ditching them for my boyfriend Two years ago, I (22F) decided to spend new years with my two friends (21F and 22F) instead of my boyfriend (24M). The way I handled that situation was extremely shitty. I was so caught up in trying to \"please everyone\", that I ended up neglecting how my boyfriend felt, and making a decision that didn't even reflect what I actually wanted to do. This understandably caused a lot of conflict in my relationship which took months of communication to improve. I understand that spending new years together is important to him. I assured him that any plans for new years would involve him going forward. \n\nMy two friends expressed to me last week that they wanted to spend new years together. They said they'd be depressed if they ended up doing nothing. I remembered that my boyfriend mentioned that he might be hosting a New Year's party and I'd let them know if they could come.\n\nThis understandably got their hopes up and the week after, they asked me about it. I sent my boyfriend a text to ask and he let me know that he was planning on going through with it. I stupidly told them straight away that the party was happening. I asked him if they could come, and he informed me that he'd prefer if they didn't as he wanted it to just be close family and friends. \n\nI told my boyfriend the situation I was in and how my friends have been telling me how upset they'll be if we don't do anything. Looking back, this was a shitty thing to say, because my friend's feelings have nothing to do with him. I realise now that I was putting pressure on my boyfriend to \"fix\" this problem by inviting two people to the party that he didn't even want there (and that we have had issues with over in the past). \n\nI very quickly recognised what was happening and I knew that I had to put my foot down and stop this behaviour. I knew that I had to tell my friends that I wasn't going to spend new years with them. \n\nAt this point I know that I've already upset my boyfriend and that I should have never mentioned the party in the first place. I should have told them immediately that I was going to spend new years with him instead of trying to orchestrate some sort of \"solution\" at the detriment of my boyfriend. \n\nI sent them a message last night explaining that I was not going to be spending new years with them. I let them know that I didn't realise that the party was only going to be close family and friends and that I felt awful for getting their hopes and then jumping ship.\n\nKnowing my friends, I know that they won't end up doing anything for new years because I have pulled out. I have messed this whole situation up so badly and upset both sides. I feel terrible. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI tried to avoid conflict with my friends by inviting them to my boyfriend's New Year's party without stopping to consider what he wanted. After finding out that he didn't want them at the party, I had ended up canceling on my friends and letting them down after getting their hopes up.",

    "text": "TIFU by confidently assuming I could fix a “minor clog” I woke up this morning feeling way too good about myself for a Monday, which should’ve been the first warning sign. Look, the sink in my bathroom had been draining slowly for a few days, and instead of doing the sensible thing and calling maintenance, I decided to take it on myself. I watched one YouTube video - literally one - and immediately thought I was some kind of plumbing prodigy. Spoiler: I was not. I took the U‑bend off, fully expecting a clump of hair or something equally unpleasant. What I did NOT expect was for the pipe to basically burp out what I can only describe as primordial goo. It splattered all over the vanity, my shirt, and somehow the ceiling. I mean, I jerked back so hard I hit my elbow on the towel rack, which made me drop the U‑bend, which then rolled under the cabinet. I scrambled to grab it, knocked over the cleaning supplies, and managed to hit the open bottle of Drano, which then started slowly spreading across the floor like a chemical crime scene. In a panic, I tried to “temporarily” reattach the U‑bend while the sink was still open and dripping. I didn’t tighten it enough, so when I tested the water, it blasted out like a tiny busted fire hydrant, soaking the underside of the cabinet and every roll of toilet paper I owned. At this point my bathroom smelled like sewer soup and wet cardboard. That’s when maintenance knocked - turns out the downstairs neighbor had already reported water dripping from their ceiling. So now I’m standing there covered in mystery sludge, my sink is somehow worse than before, and the maintenance guy gives me the most defeated “why would you do this” look I’ve ever seen in my life. I just muttered something about “DIY confidence” and accepted my fate. TL;DR Tried to fix a slow drain with YouTube-level plumbing skills, unleashed bathroom chaos, soaked everything, and caused a leak into my neighbor’s apartment.",

The transaction is refused twice. I check my balance. I have €44 in my card, no cash. \n\nI try to bank transfer some more money from another savings account but because my brain is still operating on Windows 95 after the blackout, I fail to tick the \"instant transfer\" option (why is this even a thing?) and stand there confused as to why it’s not appearing.\n\nSo I sheepishly tell them I only have  €44 like an absolute dickhead and now I owe the vet six euros, and probably a shelf. \n\nDog is fine.\nMy back hurts.\nThe vet thinks fainting = lack of \"courage\" so basically called me a wimp 😤\n\nOh, also, they waved me goodbye as I had to drive home alone through dark twisty mountain roads with my fucked up back and even more fucked up dog. \n\nTL;DR: \nDog got stitches. I helped hold it down at a hot, stuffy vet, fainted, banged my back. Vet shouted at me, offered me liquor to recover from fainting. I accepted the liquor therefore breaking my 9 month sober streak. Bill €50, had €44, now owe €6. FML.",

    "text": "TIFU by being the only one who laughed at something said in spanish and outing my self on knowing spanish I work in a warehouse that is filled with mainly hispanics. My warehouse manager (tom), two other people (Jeff and Bill) and myself are the only non hispanic people. Everyone there mainly speaks spanish to one another unless they have to speak to Jeff, Bill or myself. Tom is fluent in spanish and speaks to them in spanish usually but speaks to us in english\n\n  \nWhen I got hired my warehouse manager brought we around and introduced me to a few people. With my background in warehouse management I got hired as a team lead. As a non hispanic person and younger than almost everyone I stuck out allot. I didn't mind and knew they would get to like me, especially once I told them I was married into a hispanic family and had aunts and uncles who were hispanic. I was also excited to speak to them in spanish as it's my second language and I always enjoy being able to speak it.\n\nWell during my tour of the place I got introduced to Jeff, Bill and other people I will be managing but before I got around to everyone there was side remarks from people saying in spanish after walking away about how it's stupid that some \"Young white boy\" is going to help manage a large group of hispanics. \n\nJeff and Bill, who were on the tour with Tom and myself, explained how they would be bullied at times for not speaking spanish and the others would constantly talk to them first in spanish and then say sorry and switch to english. Tom hired me specifically because of my past work with him and because he knew I understood spanish but also understands the majority of the people who work there are fluent in spanish as their 1st language and would not respect someone who doesn't understand it, which is why they bully Jeff and Bill at times.\n\nI understood the situation and did not mind, it would make me mad too if someone got hired to run a team that mainly spoke spanish and he didn't speak any spanish. However they didn't even give me a chance to let them know I can before judging me. \n\nAfter the tour Tom and I sat down in his office to go over the job and we spoke about me speaking spanish part and them automatically thinking I don't know it. He said that it's a typical warehouse where they will haze the new guy to make sure he's a good fit but they are all decent dudes who work hard. So we jokingly agreed we would joke with them back by not telling them I can speak spanish but only knew certain words to get by in the warehouse.\n\n  \nWell cut to about 9 months on the job. I've been doing a good job by this time leading my team. They respect and follow my lead for the most part. However they speak their minds in spanish about me to my face. At first I found it very disrespectful but after awhile I used it as a tool to help me manage them. \n\nWell one day while a group of us were in the breakroom someone was telling a joke in spanish. I was busy eating my lunch by myself as usual not really paying attention to what was being said. The person was who was telling the joke is the usual class clown but at times his humor can be a little immature for the other guys but I found most of it funny. \n\nWell during this particular joke no one got the punch line but I did, but not only did I get it but I laughed really hard and no one else was laughing but the guy who told the joke. \n\nThe entire room looked at me puzzled. I had nothing in front of me. No book, no phone, nothing. There is nothing I would be laughing at other than what he said. A few of them then started to crowed me and one started to talk to me in spanish asking me if I understood them. I pretended to be clueless till they got closer and closer till they had cornered me. He again, very close and tough like, asked me again if I understood them and if I lied and they found out later that I lied they would kick my ass. \n\nI'm much smaller than him and the person who was threatening was a felon, not that all felons are dangerous and bad people as allot of the people working there were ex cons, but I knew him enough to understand he was serious. So I spoke to him back in spanish.\n\nThe room got crazy and they allot of them started to realize that they have been talking shit their superiors face for the past 9 months. After a long talk with them they calmed down and actually thought it was hilarious and I now have allot more respect from them and I now talk to them all in spanish.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I did not tell the hispanic filled warehouse I spoke spanish until 9 months later I was the only one to laugh at a joke said in spanish and gave away my secret.",

And what do you know, they accepted but I had no idea. After they accepted my application I was supposed to pay a fee so I could actually go, but I didn’t know that because again, didn’t have access to that email. Two months goes by and I decided i should actually get into that email, so I did. And what do you know, because I didn’t pay the fee that I had no idea about, my application was rejected.

It was already nighttime, but he wanted me to see it right away. After some time driving, we stopped at a small old stone church on a little hill. The hill was actually a graveyard, since people were buried underneath it in unmarked graves.\n\nThe church was locked with a chain, so we sat in front of the doors. I was just telling my boyfriend how my friend and I used to tell our kids it was a princess’s castle because it looked like one. Then I sang a song called “Princess, Say Hello” just for fun.\n\nAnd then we heard five rhythmic knocks from inside.\n\nCold horror climbed up my spine. We both looked at each other, stood up instantly, and ran. I shouted, “We’ll come back to save you, Princess, when we find the courage!”\nBut we still haven’t.\nMaybe one day in the future.\n\nTL;DR I called out to a deceased princess in an abandoned, locked church, and someone answered by knocking.",

You know, something thoughtful and romantic, right? So I decided to make a homemade pasta with a creamy sauce, garlic bread, and a fresh salad. Simple, but elegant.\n\nI spent hours in the kitchen, trying to follow the recipe, checking the ingredients over and over to make sure I wasnt missing anything. Everything seemed to be going great until I tried to fry the chicken for the pasta. I guess I got distracted by the sound of a movie playing in the background and... forgot the oil was getting too hot. You can guess what happened next. The chicken burned. Badly. I didnt want to ruin the whole thing, so I threw more oil in the pan to try and salvage it, but it just got worse.\n\nAt this point, I could smell smoke, and I looked around to see that a few paper towels had caught fire. Of course they had. I grabbed the first thing I could findmy dish toweland tried to swat out the flames, only to knock it into the frying pan, making everything worse. The smoke was so bad the entire apartment started filling up, and before I could even process it, the fire alarm started going off.\n\nI was frantically waving my arms, trying to turn off the alarm, but it only made it louder. Meanwhile, shes standing there, wide-eyed, not sure whether to laugh or be worried. I dont blame her.\n\nLong story short, we ended up eating frozen pizza and laughing at how much of a disaster my \"romantic\" dinner was. And as for the chicken and garlic bread? Well... let's just say I wont be cooking for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my date with a home-cooked dinner, caught my kitchen on fire, set off the fire alarm, and ended up ordering pizza instead.",

Here we go.\n\nI was on one of those city buses that has that sudden *jerk-stop-then-yeet-forward* routine every few blocks. Since all the seats were taken, I was standing with my backpack slung over one shoulder, trying to look casual while checking the route on my phone.\n\nThe bus lurched, my backpack slid, and my whole center of gravity basically said, \"Good luck, girl.\" I stumbled forward, attempted to catch myself on one of those metal poles missed and ended up accidentally grabbing this poor guys ARM instead. I mean, full hand-wrap, like I was his Victorian wife fainting at the opera.\n\nThe guy just blinked at me. The woman behind him snorted. I apologized about nine times, and then, because the universe personally hates me, the bus lurched *again* and I bumped into him a second time. At that point, I just gave up on existing.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I finally got off, the driver called out, \"Careful now!\" as if I were a toddler learning to walk.\n\nI immediately texted my boyfriend, and he said it sounds on brand, which thanks?? I guess??\n\nAnyway, Im hiding in a café until the humiliation wears off.\n\nTL;DR: I lost my balance on a crowded bus, accidentally grabbed a strangers arm like we were in a soap opera, bumped into him again, and now Im dealing with the aftermath.",

    "text": "TIFU by having a Pavlovian sexual response to jelly beans  First, some context. When me and my wife got married last year, a relative of hers gave us a jar full of jelly beans (eloquently labeled as “Sex Beans”) that we had to take one out of whenever we did the devils tango, with the end goal to have it empty within a year. \n\n  Don’t ask why this relative gave us something like that, but just know they are the exact kind of person that you think would give a “gift” like that. \n\n Anyways, we decided to play along with the joke for a while and would take them out when stuff went down. I slowly began to get excited every time my wife would open the jar and pull one out to signal her intentions. It even got to the point where I saw those giant containers of them at Costco and it would give me the same response (shameful, I know. Down bad for the beans). \n\n Fast forward to today, apparently she had some friends coming over to the house before she got off work. It’s pretty typical for them to come over before she’s home, and I usually just say hi and continue working on my computer in a different room. \n\n   But today when I walked into the living room, I saw one of her friends grabbing a handful of the jelly beans throwing them into her mouth like a cartoon character. You can probably guess what started happening to me in that situation. \n\n  I was so friggin embarrassed and had to go shut the door on myself to tell my wife what happened. I told her on the phone while she was on her way home and she just started cackling in her car, didn’t help me much. \n\n  I felt bad for getting aroused by someone other than her, but it was just my body’s response to seeing the beans come from the jar. My wife was more amused than insulted it seems like and now she won’t let me forget about it. Oh well.\n\nTL:DR - Me and my wife got a gag gift with jelly beans to eat one every time we did the hanky panky. I developed a Pavlovian response to my wife with the beans so bad, that seeing someone else grabbed the beans got me going.",

And then, seemingly out of nowhere, my iMessage finally delivered the picture. She clicked on the notification thingy thinking I sent a regular message. It was not. It was a close up of my fully erect penis, blasted on the screen in full view. She said she slammed the laptop down as fast as she could but it was too late. Her father, mother, and brother all seen what was on the screen. She said there was an awkward silence after that and the brother just said “oooohhhkay then”. Nobody has spoken of it and it seems to be a toss it under the rug and never speak about it thing.\n\nTL;DR I accidentally blasted my gf’s laptop screen with my meat in front of her family because my iMessage was too slow to send the pictures.",

    "text": "TIFU by giving my nephew a haircut Basically, he was scared to go to a barber and said when other family cut his hair it pulled a lot, so I told him I could do it for him since I know how to cut my own hair.\n\nEverything went fine, just a basic cut all around, but then it got to the front...Long story short, I cut too much around his forehead and now it looks weird. It's not horrible, but it's definitely a hairline that's an inch or so higher up than it should be. Not a LeBron James level hairline, but it's not normal either. Luckily he only has a week left of school before winter break, but I'm hoping it's not so bad where anyone at school makes fun of him about it because that's obviously not his fault. I'm just hoping so badly it grows back quick and covers up/fills in the forehead where it doesn't look too bad.\n\nIt sucks too because he was enjoying me cutting his hair for a change because I know how to use the cutter and it didn't hurt him and he wasn't scared and he was having fun, but I think it's safe to say I won't be trusted to ever do this again. Obviously it's a mistake but I feel so horrible over this, and of course all family members are pissed at me even though it's 95% fine minus that hairline and its not a mistake I'll make again. I'm sure we can all laugh about it...once the current hair grows back, but the weeks until then....\n\nIf I mess up on something that just impacts me I'm fine with because it's on me, but messing up on something that impacts someone else, and in this case a physical appearance, even if it's only temporary, I feel so awful over right now.\n\nTL;DR: Cut my nephews hair for the first time and I messed up his forehead/hairline where it's an inch or two higher up/shorter than it should be",

    "text": "TIFU by baking cookies Today I fucked up by wanting to bake some cookies. It was a snow day yay! No school! But that meant lots of catching up to do boo! So to procrastinate, I twiddled my thumbs in the dinner room with some of my family, I mention that I’m craving chocolate (I’m on my period booo) and my little brother says we have half a bag of chocolate chips. Perfect, I have an excuse to do something that looks productive and I get sweets out of it. \nI get to baking, I’ve done chocolate chip cookies enough to know what I’m doing. But when I get to adding butter horror strikes as I used calcium butter and it makes the dough extremely sticky. To remedy this I added a butt load of flour, the dough was still a little sticky but good enough. I pop them into the oven and 10 minutes later out comes some really puffy cookies, bland but not bad. \nNow this is where I fucked up, I was talking about how I messed up the cookies with my dad and mentioned how I used “bad butter” (like it wasn’t right for this kind of thing) this set something off because he started to accuse me of not taking responsibility and not holding myself accountable by putting the blame on the butter. He proceeded to say “this is what’s wrong with America!” (???????) he’s been watching a lot more conservative/red pilled media and I think this related to that (?). \nI’m confused at this point and start to shut down (a bad habit of my when it comes to conflict) I tell him it’s not me deflecting my mistake just pointing out where I went wrong. He throws the cookie he was eating on the ground and says he doesn’t want it anymore and that I should throw the rest away (when I move to do that he stops me, so I don’t think he was being serious.) he tells me that I should prove that it’s the butter, so I can see for myself what went wrong and insists that we go to the store right now and buy more. I refuse since I didn’t want to do that and the whole point of making the cookies was to use the last of the chocolate chips. \nHe went to talk to my mother about going to the store I didn’t really hear what he said as I was getting ready to shovel the driveway. When he came back and I once again refused to go (reiterating my previous point and saying I had other things to do-like shovel the drive way) he interrupted me mid sentence and told me to “stop talking, don’t talk to me the rest of the day….your a disappointment”\nNow never have I ever heard him call me that, especially over cookies. At that point I had no idea how to react. I just stood there as he walked away, I could feel tears well in my eyes but I just couldn’t care I felt so tired that I took a moment and then went out to shovel. The cherry on top that literally less than 30 minutes ago he was hugging me and telling me how much he loved and how he’d take a butllet for me lol. \n\nTL;DR: I used the wrong butter when making cookies, I mentioned this to my dad (referring to it as “bad butter”) he took this as me not taking responsibility for my mistakes. When I refused to go to the store to buy more butter to test this he called me a disappointment.",

    "text": "TIFU by not going to my wife’s cousins funeral I (21 f) grew up christian and have a lot of religious trauma from purity culture and growing up as a lesbian in the church. my final straw with religion was after roe v wade was overturned and my congregation clapped and cheered. i was disgusted, walked out and never looked back. i made a vow to myself to never ever walk into another church in my life again. i met my wife (20 f) online and moved to utah from california to be with her. she grew up mormon (has sense left the church) but has a very active mormon family. i do not like the mormon church, from their shady history to what they did to my wife for being gay, i am not a fan of the religion to say the least. i live in utah and there is a mormon church on every corner and despite her families pleads to get my wife and i to go to church, i have successfully not stepped foot in a church or religious space since i made my promise to myself. \n\n My wife’s 4 year old cousin died from a disability he was born with and his parents were having his funeral in a mormon church. it is important to mention i have never met the parents or this child, i would only go to support my wife but supporting her would break my promise and the nature of the service (praying, reading verses, etc) would make me uncomfortable and trigger my religious trauma i have spent years trying to undo. plus as a visible lesbian i would not feel safe in a space like that. i told my wife i didn’t feel comfortable going to the funeral because it was in a church and she said it was fine and i didn’t have to go in but asked if could i drive with her. i sat in the parking lot during the service and when my wife got in the car after she was visibly upset. she was sad from the service but was also upset with me for not being there to comfort her during a traumatic time in her family. i was annoyed because she told me i didn’t have to go and if she wanted me to be there she should’ve just told me in the first place. we got in a huge argument. i felt guilty that i wasn’t there for my wife but i also didn’t want to be in a church, especially a mormon one, and going to the funeral would be crossing a important boundary i set for myself. i know i fucked up and should’ve just sucked it up for my wife’s sake and gotten over myself. we argued about what will happen when her parents or grandparents die and ended up not talking the rest of the night. we’ve had a tense couple of days and now her family is being weird towards me which has further damaged our relationship because they didn’t like me being “the lesbian who took their daughter away” in the first place. TL;DR i didn’t go to my wife’s cousins funeral because i don’t go into churches and now my wife and her family is mad at me",

    "text": "TIFU By Telling My Friends Cousin She Isn't Cherokee and Cursing Let me start off by saying that I myself am not Cherokee but I am of another Tribe and a little Columbian. I dislike it when anyone brings up blood quantum and don't think it's an indicator of one's right to their heritage.\\\nI'm me (20M), my friend: Able (21M), and his cousin: Cassidy (mid 20F). All fake names.\n\nCassidy has been saying she's Cherokee for a few years but her family tells her that they don't know for sure.\\\nHer mom's parents are from Ireland and somewhere near Germany while her dad's parents are from New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nHer maternal grandparents often like to share their stories growing up and how much has changed since they moved to the US but most don't listen to them.\n\nHer paternal grandparents said they often moved from state to state with their kids but eventually settled after one of them got sick with something.\nHer dad hasn't liked me ever since I met them and rarely talks to me, so I mainly keep my distance and try not to interact with him.\n\nI mainly noticed she says she's Cherokee when I'm near her and didn't think too much of it since I've met a lot of Cherokee, but she usually wears other tribes patterns and jewelry.\\\nI once asked her about one of her jewelry pieces since it looked Sioux and I've only met 3, she said she bought it at a store because it called out to her.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I took half the day off from cleaning a house to meet up with Able to see if he'd be available to join me for a holiday party one of his honorary uncles was throwing since they rarely get to see each other as much and because I probably wouldn't know anyone else at the party.\n\nHe agreed and we planned out a schedule but Cassidy and her parents walked in and she asked why I was invited.\\\nI explained to her why and she had a disgusted look on her face and the conversation went something like this:\n\nC: You're (Tribe Name) and not Christian or catholic, why are you celebrating Christmas? You already had Thanksgiving to celebrate.\\\nA: You're right, but he's family to us. You already know the Thanksgiving stories, why are acting like it never happened?\\\nMe: Your family usually invites me, why is this different?\\\nC: Because we're both native and our uncle probably just wants to flaunt him to everyone at the party, he's gone crazy since his wife passed.\\\nA: His kids will be there, he loved his wife, and our family keeps saying we aren't sure we're Cherokee, have you been enrolled or anything?\nC: No, you don't even need to be 'enrolled' to be Cherokee, they take anyone. Why do you think so many say they are Cherokee?\"\nMe: You need a Tribal ID Card, like mine.\n\nI show her my card and she looked confused since she's mainly heard others call me by my nickname 'shorty' since I'm 5'1 and most can't pronounce it.\\\nShe called her mom over since her dad went outside with other family members and her mom just said \"Everyone is a little Cherokee, they were civilized with the other 4 Tribes, unlike those other savages tribes.\"\n\nAble and I were too stunned to say anything back to either of them, I asked if we can go to his room to not say anything we might regret when Cassidy spoke up.\n\nC: Why are you acting like you didn't know? It's not my fault my Tribe followed the Europeans.\nA: Just drop it and leave us alone.\nC: Why are you two acting weird? Were you replaced by sk*nw*lk*rs or something?\n\nI lost it and unmasked and said something I regret or at least wish I didn't say out loud to her face.\n\nMe: Shut the fuck up already, that isn't even similar to a shapeshifter you dumb and sad excuse for a person.\\\nEven if you were Cherokee, you would know that isn't even yours! It's mine and my culture, you fucking whites took everything from us, our land, our women, our cousins, and now our culture?! Fuck off!\n\nI grabbed Able to go to his went to his room so can I took a cold bath to cool off and let some tears out as we talked.\\\nI heard Cassidy's mom yell at us to get back and apologize to her daughter, some of the family came inside to see what the yelling was about.\n\nAble's dad knocked at the door and asked to speak to us, Able let him in and we talked while I wiped my tears, dried off and got dressed.\\\nWe told him what happened and took our side, he apologized profusely and said he had some responsibility for inviting them.\n\nAble and I left to the park and heard his dad chew them out and kicked them out, most of their family is on our side but few of them agree with Cassidy.\\\nI try to mask most of myself but today was one of the day I couldn't hold it anymore.\n\nAm I wrong for reacting the way I did?\n\nTL;DR: I got mad and cursed at my friends cousin for acting like she's Cherokee and using my culture without care for it or other Tribes. She also doesn't think I should celebrate the holidays since I'm not religious like them.",

    "text": "TIFU by congratulating my coworker? TIFU.... I know I did, I know ITA...but is there anything I can do to make this better? \n\nSo my coworker, K (30sF) is married with a toddler. I don't know all the details, but I know she had a crappy go of it when she was pregnant with/postpartum with her first kiddo. She was really sick, and I heard she had a couple emergency surgeries in the year after she had her baby. She's a nice lady; a little quiet and tends to keep to herself, but will smile and talk to you if you approach her. \n\nAnyways, it's been a bit of a not-so-secret-secret that she and her husband have been trying for Baby #2 for a while now. I dunno, maybe a year? This morning at work, I overheard my office-mates chatting amongst themselves, discussing how K has 'already popped' and 'they hope this time goes better for her'. I assumed I'd missed the memo, and K had announced a pregnancy! \n\nSo, when I see K standing in the hallway later, having a snack, I also see that she does definitely have what looks like a little baby bump. She's pretty tall and thin, so it's not like it was hard to notice... Wanting to be friendly and happy for her, I walk up, smile, and tell her congratulations on the new pregnancy! \n\nImagine my shock and surprise when K stares at me, tears up, and literally walks away crying without a word! A couple other coworkers witnessed this, and an older lady who is friends with K outside work pulled me aside and told me that K is actually in 'the waiting window', doesn't know if she's pregnant or not, and has been getting approached by multiple people about her stomach this week. Apparently, my congratulations were the straw that broke the camel's back?? \n\nAnyways, I know I screwed up. I shouldn't have said anything without knowing for sure. K has been avoiding everyone, staying glued to her desk and not looking up at anyone. I feel awful, but also...she literally looks pregnant?? She wasn't even hiding the bump??? It's common knowledge that she and her husband want at least one more kid???? \n\nWhat should I do? I feel bad, and want to apologize, but I also don't want to make this worse by talking to K about it more... :-(\n\nTldr; I congratulated a coworker on her 'pregnancy' without confirming she was actually pregnant. Turns out she doesn't know either, and started crying. How do I make this better?",

    "text": "TIFU by confidently fixing something in my house that did not actually need fixing This morning I noticed my bathroom fan was making a weird rattling sound. I immediately assumed something was loose because the house is older and everything creaks like it’s haunted. I grabbed a screwdriver, stepped on the sink (bad idea), and started taking the cover off like I was a certified electrician who knew what I was doing.  \nAbout ten minutes into this very unnecessary operation, I took a break and at one point I was playing on rollingriches, looking up “how to clean a bathroom fan,” only to realize the rattling noise wasn’t the fan at all it was a loose plastic bottle in the cabinet below vibrating whenever someone walked by.\n\nMeaning: I dismantled a perfectly fine fan for absolutely no reason.  \nWhen I went to put everything back, I realized I had somehow turned the simple cover into a jigsaw puzzle. The screws wouldn’t line up, the frame wouldn’t sit straight, and I ended up spending 40 minutes trying to fix the thing I “fixed.”\n\nSo now my fan looks worse than before, the noise was never coming from it, and the real culprit was a $2 bottle that just needed to be moved.\n\nTL;DR Thought my bathroom fan was broken. Took it apart. Fan was fine. Noise was a loose bottle. Now the fan cover is crooked forever.",

    "text": "TIFU, by forgetting to add coins..(well it happens in 1984) My last post here some 9 years ago kinda blew up. It has been published in 3 books and even adapter to a tv/web episode.. so I thought I would tell you about a thing that happened the year before I foolishly got my appendix removed in GDR because I did not have the balls to admit that I was hung over.. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/NCXilPaqcV\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so sorry for any errors.\n\nI was going to High School in a small town in Western New York, and were visiting my mothers aunt in Brooklyn. I am Norwegian by the way and was an AFS student at the time.\n\nTimes Square in 1984 was not what it is today. It was filled with porn theaters, recruiters for the U.S. Army, hustlers selling watches from open suitcases. Steam rose from grates. Costumed men handed out flyers. The Naked Cowboy, I think or it might be a false memory and mixed with later visits to New York, in just a hat, stars-and-stripes briefs, and a guitar, stood there. Manic eyes fixed on the crowd. Hormones drove me up 42nd Street, into a cinema. The floor was sticky with spilled soda. I stumbled into the screening of the movie Phantasm, a silver ball drilling itself into a man’s forehead on the screen. Not what I wanted. I wandered into another theater, lined with dark booths. I exchanged bills for quarters, slipped into a cubicle. The seat was sticky, the walls streaked white with old stains. I tried not to think too hard about them. A screen flickered on when I inserted a coin  and I saw John Holmes, Seka, Ron Jeremy. I didn’t dare do what others did. I left quickly. Further down the street was a peep show. Inside the building a circular platform. Women behind plexiglass, dancing. I paid through a slot. A Black woman stripped for me, laughing, teasing. “Do your thing, honey,” she said. I hesitated. She laughed harder. “Drop your pants, boy. Slap your monkey. Strangle your snake.” Her words hit me like a command. I obeyed. Awkwardly, trembling, I lowered my pants and began to touch myself. She spread herself for me, her purple lips pulled apart to reveal tender pink. My eyes were wide, my heart pounding. I climaxed quickly, clumsily, like the boy I was. And then the door swung open. I had forgotten to feed more quarters into the machine. I stood frozen, pants at my ankles, semen dripping, exposed to the entire crowd outside. Laughter exploded, cruel and roaring. Faces tilted back, mouths open. The girl behind the glass doubled over, laughing at me too. I pulled my pants up, stumbled, tripped on the baggy legs, and fell face-first. My torso landed across the threshold of the booth, into something cold and sticky. I didn’t need to guess what it was. The smell told me enough. My clothes were smeared with other men’s seed. Desperate, humiliated, I scrambled up. More laughter. Pointing fingers. My face burned. I wanted the floor to swallow me. Then, through the chaos, a heavyset Black woman appeared. She pulled me away, into a small side room lit only by a red bulb. She wiped me down with wet towels. Then she smiled and told me to go home. I left in a daze. The smell of that place stayed with me. Salt and sweat, perfume and filth. The sticky booths, the narrow-eyed girls, the men who shuffled between cubicles with buckets and rags. And the laughter, the fucking endless, echoing laughter. I never wanted to experience it again\n\nTL;DR I forgot to put enough coins in to a peep show cabin and ended up stumbling on my own pants and falling on loads of other men’s sperm… Edit: a number and a link",

    "text": "TIFU by accidentally turning something innocent into potential sexual harassment Just 5 hours ago, I went to a mall to buy a bottle of silicone lubricant for my ROKR Marble Squad mechanical model. **Important detail, it's made of wood**. \n\nSince I lost the silicone stick that comes with the box, my only option was to get a WD-40 silicone spray.\n\nSo I searched for a cheaper alternative used for skin care and went to a physical store to avoid shipping fee. It was located at the beauty section within the department store. The receptionist in the area was a young lady just doing her work.\n\nSo I walked up and asked her where could I find some silicone lubricant. Went to the Isle that she pointed me to. I'm just gonna grab whatever is on sale and is the cheapest, my eyes was only paying attention to 2 words \"Silicone\" &amp; \"Lubricant\".\n\nWent to the receptionist, I thought it wood be funny to make a joke that the lubricant was not for me, since I don't do skin care. Here's the dialogue:\n\n\n\nMe: \"For the record, this is not for me.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Don't worry, I'm not going to judge.\"\n\nMe: \"No I'm just kidding, it's actually for a piece of wood.\" Get it? It's for a wooden model \n\nThe innuendos completely flew past me. Then she wishes me have a great day, the usual.\n\n  \nI only realized what just happened when I replayed the situation after walking through the front door. I have never felt so fucking stupid and embarrassed in my life. But the punchline came after I look at the bottle. \"Silicone-Based Intimate Gel.\" And now I'm officially a creep to someone, maybe. I would probably avoid the store for the foreseeable future.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Went to buy some Silicone Lubricant for my toy model in a beauty shop because I'm a cheapskate. Ended up making inappropriate sexual joke to the receptionist, as the innuendoes flew over my head. Big Surprise! I look at the Silicone Gel product after walking out the store, and it was for sexual purpose. Now I'm a creep to someone.",

    "text": "TIFU by trying to lick my face clean Obligatory typing on phone\n\nThe setting, my partner and I were at an event and there was some free ice cream. So I got myself an ice cream sandwich and chow down on it. After I finished it I saw a friend and went to talk to them. So while I'm talking with them my partner comes over and is looking at me. Once I notice them, they say something and then make a motion with their finger on their face to tell me I have something on my face. It's a little hard to hear since there's karaoke happening. Now I know I'm a messy eater and often get food on my face, so while I didn't process what they said yet I just took the indicator that it was near my upper lip and assumed it was from the ice cream sandwich. Thinking it's just food I go to lick it and that's when it's too late. My tongue is already in motion and there's no stopping once I realize what my partner said. \"There's an insect on your face,\" and in that moment my tongue hits the bug. Now I didn't eat cause I immediately do spitting action to blow it off my tongue sending it flying to it's certain death. So now I'm standing there looking at my partner and friend's horrified faces as they think I intentionally went to eat the bug. Trying to make things better I just say, \"I killed it.\" They were not pleased with that. They start questioning why would I lick it and I tried to explain I didn't think it was a bug. My partner, who hates all bugs, wouldn't let me kiss them until I cleaned my mouth. Honestly found it funny how much more they reacted than I did.\n\nTLDR; I licked a bug off my face thinking it was going to be ice cream. My partner was not happy.",

    "text": "TIFU by switching my boss's coffee? .Two weeks ago my boss (43m) sent me (27m) an email which I found out later he sent to the rest of the office. He made us aware that the coffee brand the company buys us is no longer being provided. We all got quite enraged as the brand we are given isn't even expensive (around $6 per 100g) we are not a big company with about 15 staff total. We have each tried to make attempts to persuade him against it but he really won't budge.\n\nAfter a week with a completely coffee-less staff thing started to get tense, many pointed out that this simple purchase made the office staff feel more like a joint team in a way. but no matter what we said he wouldn't budge on his stance. Me and my roommate (28m) who we will call mathew, decided it was time to be petty.\n\nFor some background our boss drinks EXPENSIVE coffee and has never let anyone taste it before. I've found out it's about 100ish nz dollars 57ish USD for his instant coffee(he buys it online). He constantly raves about his \"perfectly smooth instant coffee” and we all have become sick of it. Me and Mathew went to the supermarket and brought a tub of what we'd normally be provided and waited for my next shift. Our shift starts don't line up so it was all on me to complete what we called the great coffee hist. \n\nOn Monday I came into work 20 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive and snuck into his office and switched the coffee. It was a fresh container. By the looks of it he had only had one drink. I switched the coffee powder labels between the containers, so he believed that i had brought in my own one from home but really i took his… this only worked because he would top our coffee up in one of his old containers because it came in a bag.\n\nLater that morning i went in to conveniently chat to him to see how the coffee was treating him and it turns out HE LOVED IT. He told me that he didn't know what happened, but it got better overnight!! I had to practically run out of there to stop myself from laughing in his face.\n\nI found Matthew to tell him what happened and him and the other colleagues around were dubbed over in laughter. But some kept calling me a jerk. This lead me to think that i may have made a grave mistake.\n\nTL;DR: today i made a mistake by switching my bosses coffee",

    "text": "TIFU by replying to the wrong person and ruining my peaceful week This actually happened two days ago and I’m still dealing with the consequences. I was texting my friend, complaining about how a coworker keeps scheduling “urgent” meetings that are never actually urgent. You know the type. The kind of person who sends a calendar invite at 8pm and then shows up late to their own meeting.\n\nSo I typed out this whole message to my friend saying something like “If he schedules one more fake emergency meeting I’m going to throw my laptop out the window.” Nothing too wild, just regular workplace frustration.\n\nExcept I didn’t send it to my friend.\n\nI sent it to the coworker.\n\nThe coworker who schedules the meetings.\n\nI realized the moment my phone buzzed with his name at the top of the screen. My soul genuinely tried to exit through my ears. I opened the chat and there it was. My entire rant sitting proudly in our work conversation like a confession letter.\n\nHe replies with “Noted.”\n\nThat’s it. Just “Noted.”\n\nAnd then he cancels our next meeting. And the one after that. Then he stops messaging me altogether and starts sending entire paragraphs of updates through the project manager as if we suddenly need a mediator.\n\nI tried apologizing but he left me on seen, which somehow feels worse than if he yelled.\n\nNow the entire vibe at work is weird. My boss asked if everything was ok between us and I had to pretend we were totally fine while silently praying my coworker wouldn’t walk past my desk.\n\nI’ve never wished harder for a time machine.\n\n**TLDR:** Meant to complain about a coworker to my friend, accidentally sent the rant to the coworker himself, he responded with a cold “Noted” and now avoids me like I’m a health hazard.",

    "text": "TIFU fixing the hotel Jacuzzi myself So my wife and I are staying at a nice hotel in Old Montreal this week.  \nOur room has one of those jet tubs, and tonight she went to take a bath. She fills it up, hits the button… nothing. No jets. No sound. No click. Just a sad, expensive, oversized bowl of warm water.  \n  \nShe calls me in because “you’re the engineer, figure it out” (which is always how this starts). I check the button, the panel, the tub -nothing. So I think maybe the GFCI tripped? Maybe it’s unplugged? The access panel is hidden behind this little corner shelf, so I carefully lift it to peek behind......and immediately regretted every decision that led me to that moment.  \n  \nThe tub motor was unplugged (intentionally?) and right next to it was a very, uhhhh... personal item someone had clearly left behind.  \n  \nNot like “dropped behind the bed and forgotten.”\n\n  \nMore like “this was intentionally stashed here during a previous stay and absolutely should never have been rediscovered.”\n\nI mean the size of this thing gave me anxiety lol\n\nWe let the front desk know very politely, because this definitely wasn’t the fault of the staff. They were actually super professional about it - apologized, sent someone up immediately, handled everything, and even comped a few amenities for the trouble.  \n  \nBut man…wtf\n\nI was just trying to fix the jets lol \n\nTL;DR: Wife tried to take a bath, jets didn’t work, I checked behind the access panel and found the tub unplugged… and a forgotten adult artifact someone left next to the motor. Hotel handled it great, my desire to DIY bathtub repairs is permanently gone.",

    "text": "TIFU Santa Claus experience gone awry I know this might trigger some of you and I apologize in advance. \n\nLast weekend, my secret friend at Barry’s invited me to his home because his family was away. We had both wanted to roleplay at some point and we shared a Santa kink. His bachelor weekend presented him/us with an opportunity.\n\nHe wanted to be Santa and asked if I would dress up as an elf in candy cane red and white striped tights. So I showed up on Sunday after midnight (he didn’t want neighbors to see me coming in) and changed into an elf costume. He already had a Santa costume (for his kids). I wrapped a gift on his kitchen island while he watched me from his lounge chair playing with himself. When I was done with the gift, I brought it to the tree with the other gifts and that’s where we had our intimacy.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday morning, my boss called me into her office. She told me she didn’t trust her kids so she had a hidden nanny cam installed last week. Then she played a short video on her phone for me: I was on all fours in the elf costume by the tree, and Santa (her husband) going at it behind me, ho ho ho christmas tree presents and all. She said she hasn’t decided what to do yet but she wanted me to know she had the entire video.\n\nI went to HR immediately to get my side of the story on record. They asked me not to discuss this with anyone at work or with my boss. I hope I still have a job next year. \n\nTL;DR: I had fun with my secret Santa and my boss found out.",

I was still driving and didn't want to respond from my phone since I was running late and incorrectly thought my boss would know I was responding back from my Iphone and I was still TWENTY minutes away from my apartment.\n\nA few minutes goes by then she sends me a video chat.

    "text": "TIFU - Just had a job interview, and the interviewer is good friends with my current boss. How screwed am I? As the title says\n\nI just interviewed for a local company for a marketing position.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview he says “Oh so I see you work for “X” company! So you work for [boss/owners name] - her and I go way back she’s a good friend of mine we used to do work for (yadda yadda etc). She’s quite the difficult personality to get along with and a lot of people find her challenging to work for”\n\nHe kept talking about her a lot and one of his questions to me was\n\n“If I were to run into (so-and-so) and ask about you what do you think she’d say?”\n\nFuck!!!\n\nI answered the question but I was thinking in my head how do I say “please dont” without sounding like a jerk? It’s too late now because I wasn’t able to gather the courage to say please dont speak to my boss and I never did it and now I’m kicking myself\n\nI am scared she will catch wind that i am interviewing and fire me or something or speak to me about it. She is the type of person that takes it very personal when her employees seek other jobs.\n\nHow screwed am I?\n\nI am mentally preparing and accepting my fate well if I lose my job I’ll just be collecting unemployment for awhile. But the industry I am in is absolute garbage in the sense that very rarely does a position pop up for availability and it’s highly competitive.\n\nAlso I do not want to work for the place I just interviewed for as well because a lot of red flags came up in the conversation that my gut is telling me to avoid. I am planning on declining a second interview if they reach out. It’s a farther commute and not hybrid remote versus my current job which is closer and hybrid. But what piqued my interest was the salary increase and health/pto benefits and also the position was something I want to move toward career-wise. Just the company culture itself screamed red flag nightmare to me but that’s a whole other essay I could write about so I’ll spare the details. Long story short - not a good fit for me or my career goals.\n\nTLDR: Fucked up because interviewer implied that he will be asking my boss about me since he’s good friends with her. I did not have the guts to say “please dont” and am now kicking myself. I dont even want this job either after red flags in the interview conversation.",

    "text": "TIFU by picking my belly button Lemme start off by saying that I'm a pretty hygienic fella - I shower at least once a day, and after the gym as well, so I average more than 7 showers a week. I deodorize, and take care of myself. Which is what makes this TIFU so strange, or so I thought.\n\nI was on a work call last month, not paying attention and scratching various body parts to alleviate the boredom when I began picking navel fluff. After about a minute I felt a decent piece of lint that felt harder than the rest, so I gave it a pull, and it actually hurt coming out. It was a piece of dry skin or scab that I had just pulled off. I didn't think much of it and went along the rest of the day.\n\nThe following day, as I was getting undressed before showering, I noticed a red stain on my shirt. My belly button had been bleeding.\n\nThen the day after that, after my gym workout, my shirt was wet in the same spot, wetter than the first day, but not blood. It went like that for a few days, and then I woke up with a stinging sensation in my stomach/belly button area. At this point I went to the doctor (Hooray for public healthcare!), who took a look, and then prescribed me some pretty strong antibiotics. Turns out the navel is NOT a clean place, and by picking off that slab of dead skin or whatever it was, and then continuing my day, running, sweating, and all that, I had managed to get it infected. \n\nFor all my claims about cleanliness, apparently I never actually cleaned my belly button properly (raise your hand if you've ever actually dedicated any time in the shower to your belly button, don't make me be the only idiot here). And so I had to take 14 days of a pretty strong antibiotic with no drinking, so I got to be designated driver on my wife and I's group friends date night while everybody else drank. \n\nSmall fries in the larger scale of things, but bummer nonetheless.\n\ntl:dr - picked my belly button, gave myself a nasty navel infection, no alcohol for 2 weeks on the one night I get to go out with the wife and friends while the kids are asleep.\n\n(Disclaimer: English is not my first language.

    "text": "TIFU by probably ruining a family’s Christmas Over the weekend I was a volunteer ticket-taker at a theater. Mostly we were there to make sure patrons had the right date and time and direct them to the left or right entrance based on their reserved seat number. \n\nA woman came in with her three kids and showed me the tickets on her phone. Now, the clientele at this theater tend to be pretty put together - kids are in their Sunday/Xmas best and whatnot. This woman was completely disheveled and had pretty crazy energy swirling about her. The kids looked like they had just rolled out of bed and thrown on their one holiday outfit, which was probably not purchased new at a nice store, if you catch my drift. \n\nSo she shows me the tickets - the date was right, the time was right… but the venue was on the other side of the county. She went to the wrong place. Apparently this was a known problem where the other place’s website was directing customers to us. But no one told me this when I showed up to volunteer. \n\nI explained to her that she was at the wrong venue and showed her on the map where she was supposed to be. But there was basically no way to get there before their performance would start. She basically grabbed the kids and ran out before I could think of a better solution. For the record, the obvious solution was to direct her to one of the actual company employees, who (I found out later) probably would have just given her tickets since she was already there and that particular show hadn’t sold out. \n\nI feel terrible. Judging by appearances, the tickets were probably a significant splurge so she could do one nice thing for the kids this season and while I wasn’t responsible for the initial error my inability to think quickly in the moment meant no Nutcracker for them, and that’s weighing really heavily on me. \n\nTl:dr- turned away someone for having wrong tickets and probably ruined the family’s Christmas, when there was a workable solution available",

    "text": "TIFU by throwing out a family heirloom My grandmother is a retired seamstress in her late 70s. She’s made me a set of pajamas every year for Christmas since I was a kid, and over the years she’s done custom stockings, quilts, all that. As she’s gotten older that’s slowed down a lot, so anything handmade from her feels pretty special now.\n\nJust over a week ago I got a package from my grandparents. Inside were some wrapped Christmas gifts, some home baked goods, and a few (breakable) Christmas tree decorations. At the bottom of the box was a lumpy pillow.\n\nMy grandma has sent me old duvet inserts as packing material before, so I assumed it was the same deal. I took out the “pillow,” unpacked the nice stuff… and when I broke down the box for recycling, I tossed the pillow in the garbage.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, garbage day. My downstairs roommate was being nice and took the bins out to the alley for pickup. Around noon I start getting frantic texts from my girlfriend asking if I threw out the pillowcase and if the garbage had been picked up yet.\n\nThen she tells me the “pillow” was actually a custom Christmas tree skirt my grandma made for me about 5 years ago. She’d been holding onto it, waiting until I was in a more stable place before giving it to me. She put well over 100 hours into making it.\n\nThen my mom calls me crying, telling me how long my grandma had saved it for me, how much work went into it, and basically how bad I fucked up (as if I didn't already know). \n\nI got off the phone with her and frantically called the city to see if the dump truck had unloaded yet. End up talking to waste disposal manager for the city who tells me to meet the truck inside the dump so I can try and find it. Luckily the dump truck driver had stopped to buy a lottery ticket, so dispatch had time to tell him to hold off on dumping his load.\n\nI drove straight to the dump, met up with the driver, and started digging through garbage. I ended up digging through trash for well over an hour looking for it. Had like 4 other city employees helping me look.\n\nBut I actually found it.\n\nI was so relieved that genuinely cried a bit in front of a bunch of garbage men. The pillow case seems to have protected it well as it still just smells like my grandparents wood burning stove. Not a single stain or anything else that shows the journey it's been through.\n\nFor some added context, in the last 6 years I've really turned my life around. Got out of a bad relationship, quit vaping and weed, went to college, got a career and just bought a house 2 months ago. And with my new house, I'm hosting Christmas for the first time. Basically I used to let the people around me down alot and I really didn't want to do that again. \n\nI still feel so guilty about throwing it out in the first place. With the time she put in making it and how she was saving it till I was in a more stable position, how much of a slap in the face it would have been to lose it like that. Very thankful it all worked out\n\nTLDR: Threw out a lumpy \"Pillow\" that was actually a custom tree skirt my grandmother spent 100 hours making. Dug through the landfill to find it",

As we both live in Wolverhampton, the address said WV rather than WR for Worcester. \n\nTook me a second before I went, “wait a minute…who have I just messaged?” \n\nI felt so embarrassed that I just messaged back, “lovely I’ll pop it in the post today”. It’s too far gone now to turn back, it’s already in the post box. I can never go back to that place of work on my down time now- they’re going to think I’m off my head. \n\nI can honestly say I’m an overworked single mom, trying to get Christmas magic organised amongst daily living, sending gifts and cards to friends and family, whilst trying to work. I’ve got a million and one school appointments and Christmas cards for my children to write. \n\nThere was no alcohol involved. I think there may be tonight though. \n\nYes it was THAT Jeff Goldblum picture. \n\n\n\nTLDR: I messaged the wrong person (someone I barely know) asking for her address to send a Christmas card- she didn’t even have my number saved, or know who it was, and my PF is Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park. She still gave me her address.",

    "text": "TIFU by accidentally sharing my screen while \"roasting\" my boss in a group chat. Obligatory this happened yesterday and I am currently updating my resume.\n\nI work remotely. We have a weekly team meeting on Zoom. Usually, these meetings are incredibly boring, so my work bestie and I have a private Slack channel where we joke around and roast the management decisions. It keeps us sane.\n\nYesterday, my boss asked me to present our quarterly numbers. I said, \"Sure,\" and hit \"Share Screen.\"\n\n**The mistake:** I have two monitors. I *thought* I shared Screen 2 (the presentation). I actually shared Screen 1.\n\nScreen 1 had the Zoom window open, but right on top of it was my Slack chat. And right there, in bold text, was a message I had just typed:\n\n*\"If \\[Boss's Name\\] uses the word 'synergy' one more time, I'm going to scream. He has no idea what he's doing.\"*\n\nI didn't realize it for a solid 10 seconds. I was talking about the numbers. Suddenly, the Zoom call went dead silent. No one said a word. I saw my boss’s face go from bored to confused to bright red.\n\nMy work bestie messaged me on my phone: *\"BRO UN SHARE UN SHARE!!!!\"*\n\nI panic-closed the laptop. I didn't even say goodbye. I just left the meeting.\n\nIt’s been 24 hours. No one has emailed me. My slack is currently offline because I'm too scared to log in. I think I’m getting fired on Monday.\n\n**TL;DR:** Shared the wrong screen during a presentation and showed the whole company my private chat where I was trash-talking the boss.",

    "text": "TIFU by misunderstanding who brings the Christmas presents This is a story from my childhood, so it's not from today.\n\nFor context: in Poland, depending on the region, Christmas presents are brought by different people. I grew up in the part where Santa Claus brings gifts on St. Nicholas Day (December 6), and on Christmas Day we have dressed in a sheepskin coat and a red mask guy named Starman (Gwiazdor).\n\nWhen I was maybe 6 years old, I remember how in December everyone asked me what I wanted from Santa and what I wanted from Starman. Since I had seen Santa on TV more than once, I knew who to expect, but since Starman had never been featured in any movie, I had no idea what he looked like.\n\nSo how did my six-year-old brain explain who Starman was? It decided that since he was some kind of famous star, he must be... Elvis Presley, the rock star.\n\nTo this day, I remember imagining a fat Elvis in a white leather outfit with sequins leaving presents under the Christmas tree and instead of \"Ho, ho, ho,\" he said his iconic \"Aha, aha, aha.\"\n\nThis lasted for several years, until I stopped believing in Santa. I told my sister about it, and now she reminds me of this funny story every Christmas.\n\nTL;DR: I believed that Elvis was giving Christmas presents to children in Poland.",

Music is playing in the background, my mind is wandering, I'm in a good mood. I sat down to eat, and the salad tasted very strange. I ate three forkfuls and thought, no, I need to go and check if something is wrong with the ingredients. The salad leaves are fine, the cucumbers too, the tuna is still good, the capers are fresh... okay, maybe my tastebuds are a bit off, happens. Continued eating, it’s still weird. Then I go to take a double look and see that the can of tuna is actually a can of cat food. I used a cat food in my salad, and gave the actual tuna to my cats for breakfast. No shit they were so eager to get more food this morning, they had a day of their life.\n\nI brushed my teeth 4 times and could still feel the cat food, which was met with a good old diarhea a few hours later.\n\nTL;DR I used cat food instead of tuna for my tuna salad and got diarhea later :))",

    "text": "TIFU by… smelling too good? Hola, friends!\n\nI am posting on a throwaway so that if anybody finds this post I can just flat out deny that I’m the poster. Thank you! :)\n\nI’m gonna tell you a bit about my week, because you clicked on the post so I imagine you’re probably interested.\n\nBit of background, last year I got a specific prescription to help me deal with a certain chronic illness and my employer pushed back super hard. They’ve not dealt with it or mentioned anything to me about it since then… UNTIL NOW!\n\nAnyway, last week was a week like any other: \n\n21:00: I went to work in a pretty decent mood and got out of the car (struggling a little bit because of aforementioned chronic illness). I said hi to a coworker who was leaving because it was the end of his day shift. We had a short conversation, which ended with us both laughing, him getting into the car and then driving home to be with his family, as any good parent would.\n\nI went to my assigned post to have a short team meeting before going on shift. Whilst at my post waiting for the rest of my team to arrive, a coworker who I’m fairly decent friends with, told me that I had “oversprayed” a bit (my partner had just bought me a new bottle of aftershave for Christmas because my last one had ran out).\n\nThe week went on as normal and I enjoyed my days off. \n\nFast forward to today.\n\nAs with any other day 21:00, I show up at work. 21:10, I show up to the team meeting (35 minutes early). 21:25, my manager asks me to go to a conference room in the main office building. \n\nWhat I haven’t told you, is that previously the medication that they had an issue with was the good old Mary Jane. See, I’d disclosed my prescription prior to a drug test months ago and the test still came back negative. This being my employer (who really like to play around with the careers of those they don’t like) would have **100% believably** “randomly” drug tested me again to see if I’d fail.\n\nAnyway, because of that whole kerfuffle, I was under the impression that the place I was going was for a drug test so that they could dismiss me. I was half-right. It turns out I was being investigated “for cause”, meaning that somebody had actively reported that I was taking the devil’s lettuce and hadn’t told my employer.\n\nAnyway, drug tested, all negative. Some weird hostility from a line manager for seemingly no reason and no explanation as to what the allegation was from my own line manager. Interesting, but somewhat understandable.\n\nWith my drug test as apparently proof enough that I hadn’t smoked any skunk, grass, weed, pot, hash or green, I resumed my post for six hours until I was called for a meeting to address the concern. I wasn’t mad or upset about being accused, I was just curious of who would possibly have reported me for anything. I’m just a lil guy, I don’t do anything for real!\n\nEntered the meeting and the first question was a doozy. “Do you remember a conversation that you had between x and y?” Nope. I don’t remember conversations I had five minutes ago and I’m even struggling to remember this one now, to be honest. ADHD, BABY!\n\n“On the days of X and Y, do you remember struggling to get out of the car when you arrived at work?”\n\nIn hindsight, I answered this one wrong. I didn’t “struggle” to get out of the car, but it was heckin painful because of my condition. I told them “no” anyway.\n\n“On the days of X and Y, do you remember spraying yourself with deodorant to conceal the odour of cannabis?”\n\n…you’re serious? No! What?\n\n“A member of staff noted that your pupils were dilated and that your demeanour was notably different to how it is usually”\n\nMy pupils were dilated? And that was seen? At 21:00? In the North? In the Winter?\n\n“According to the report, you also kissed your girlfriend”\n\nRight, yeah. No, I didn’t do that in a public place, I actually did kiss my girlfriend but that’s because I love her very much, thank you.\n\nTL;DR: Somebody made an allegation that I had smoked some lush kush because apparently that’s the only explanation for somebody smelling strongly of aftershave. I’m now under investigation for drug use and loving my not-wife, if you can believe it.\n\nIn case any of you ask, here’s a down low FAQ:\n\n1. Q. Do you still have any cannabis?\n  \nA. Yes, I’m in possession of around an ounce of the good stuff, but as I’ve said, I’ve ceased usage of my medicine as I was forced to choose between that or my workplace sanity and I’d rather have the latter.\n\n2. Q. You shouldn’t be kissing anybody at work, they do have a point.\n\nA. That’s not a question but regardless, the way I see it is that the rules restrict personal affection that is visible in public. I’d argue that in my car, I’m not really on the grounds of the establishment and therefore am not subject to the rules unless they are legally enforceable.\n\n3. Q. How strange?\n\nA. That’s exactly what I’m saying.\n\nThanks for reading, have a good rest of your day!",

A collection of ‘used’ tissues and two bottles of lotion fill my bathroom trash can. The problem: I am at college half way across the country and my parents usually (as a sign of welcoming and kindness) nicely clean my room/bathroom, having it all ready for my return.\n\nAnyone with a brain will easily see my evidence and recognize it for what it is. I have a week and change until I return and likely a couple of days before my parents clean my bathroom and discover the product of my activities which I feel uncomfortable and nervous about having them have to remove all of those items into a trash bag.\n\nAlso, important context: the trash can in question is a model Amazon Basics Smudge Resistant Small Rectangular Trash Can With Soft-Close Foot Pedal, Brushed Stainless Steel, 12 Liter/3.1 Gallon, Satin Nickel Finish, 11.3\"L x 9.9\"W x 15.1\"H and DOESN’T HAVE A TRASH BAG INSIDE IT. That means to remove all of the contents, one has to dump it all out into a trash bag, obviously seeing the evidence.\n\nI obviously fucked up by not removing it myself, and I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’ve been thinking about telling my parents that I want to clean my room/bathroom myself because it would be a “good way to get back into living at home” (but who tf would ever deny clean/washed bed sheets and a spotless bathroom to return to?)\n\nI can’t think of a way to bullshit them not to clean my room and discover the used tissues and lube without making it seem like I have hidden drugs or something and don’t want them to discover all of it.\n\nAnd NO, I don’t have any siblings there to be confidential and do it for me before hand. Only my parents there who are in for a surprise when they discover a garbage can full of tissues and two bottles of lotion.\n\nTL;DR: I need a way to convince my parents not to clean my bathroom/room before I arrive for winter break because there’s a garbage can filled with tissues and lotion (evidence of a goon).

    "text": "TIFU by putting the wrong email address on my old Reddit account My actual mistake didn’t happen today, but instead 6 years ago when I made my previous Reddit account. I decided that it would be wise to create an alt account for my less than safe for work browsing. In my haste, lust, or probably just plain stupidity, I entered what I thought was my email for the account. As I found out today, the email I entered was one character off of what my email actually is (think like bossslayer6 vs. bosslayer6). That account is now locked. To recover the account I need to change my password, but to change my password I need to receive a link through my email to update it. However, I do not have access to the email that is attached to my account. To change my email, my account needs to be unlocked. I have contacted Reddit support, but it seems unlikely that they would be able to resolve this situation in the ways that I would like.\n\nThis may not sound too bad so far. Losing an account sucks, but ultimately all the subreddits still exist. On this account I had eventually began posting and contributing to some communities myself. Again, sucks to lose all the karma and followers and start over but it’s still possible to rebuild and grow my account again. As part of my interests, I have encouraged the users in certain communities to dm me about fantasies or potential meet-ups. Unfortunately, some poor sap has been receiving email notifications regularly from all the dm requests that my account received. They have likely also read all of the creepiness and horniness that I received over the past year. They may have seen all of the inappropriate pictures that I had both sent and received during that time (it was a lot). I hope that person learned how to block an email address.\n\nTL;DR: I created my old Reddit account with an email address that didn’t belong to me. Over the past year, they most likely have seen every NSFW Dm request that I received.",

    "text": "TIFU by accidentally flashing my DoorDash driver because I underestimated gravity. This happened about 45 minutes ago and I am currently eating my Pad Thai in the dark because I am too ashamed to look at the windows.\nFor context, I (23F) had a brutally long day at work. I came home, ordered my favorite comfort food, and decided to hop in the shower while waiting. The app said the driver was 20 minutes away, so I figured I had plenty of time to scrub off the day and get into pajamas before he arrived.\nI was wrong. I was mid-conditioner when my phone started buzzing on the counter. \"Driver is approaching.\" Panic mode engaged.\nI rinsed off in record time, jumped out, and realized I hadn't brought fresh clothes into the bathroom. I heard the knock on the front door. I didn't want to make him wait, so I grabbed my large bath towel and did the classic \"tuck and roll\" maneuver. I looked in the mirror and thought, \"Okay, this is secure. I’ll just wrap the towel tight, grab the bag, and close the door. 5 seconds max.\"\nI marched to the door with unearned confidence. I opened it, and there he was. He was a older guy, maybe 30-40, which made this infinitely worse.\nI smiled, said \"Hi!\", and reached out my right arm to grab the heavy bag of food.\nPhysics was not on my side today. I guess lifting my arm created some sort of structural failure in the towel knot. It didn't fall completely to the floor, but the top corner (the crucial part covering my chest) just... gave up. It flopped completely down.\nI wasn't wearing anything underneath.\nTime froze. He saw. I saw him see. My nipples were definitely making an appearance. I frantically used my other hand to slap the towel back up against my chest, but the damage was done.\nHe didn't even blink. He just stared for a split second, handed me the bag, and said \"Enjoy your meal\" in a super low, strained voice. He practically sprinted back to his Honda Civic.\nI locked the door and slid down to the floor. I immediately opened the app and tipped him $15 on a $20 order out of pure guilt and hush money.\nSo, to the driver if you see this: I am so sorry. Please enjoy the tip, and please don't report me for harassment 😂\n\nTL;DR: Tried to answer the door in a towel to get my dinner. Reached for the food and the towel knot betrayed me. Flashed the poor delivery driver, who ran away in terror. I paid a $15 \"please forget my boobs\" tax.",

    "text": "TIFU by triggering my brother by singing a song from our childhood TIFU, I 29(f), by triggering my brother (25m) by singing a song from our childhood. \nSo I should give some context- I feel most will know the song. It’s Johnny Cash’s “You are My Sunshine”. My brother and I are half siblings, though I never made that determination or ever specified as such; he is and will always be my baby brother. He is my brother, I love him, he will always be wanted and cherished by me and our whole family- it makes me proud knowing he knows this (he’s said as much). There was so much time apart, many nights I didn’t sleep hoping he was ok, but knowing I could not do anything. Our mums were friends once, my mum even babysat him a couple times. My dad was an a-hole back in the day (you would understand if you knew his story). My mum really fucked our dad up, my brother would at times say things my dad would about her and be extension me. It didn’t hurt, I knew they weren’t his words, he was a child. \nMy dad and he would play fight; I’d break it up jovially for the most part. But once, simply put it didn’t go that way. I had gone to grab a snack and when I returned it was chaos. I had to call an ambulance as my brother was no longer conscious, and dad was on one. \nI didn’t sleep for 3 days, my life was threatened if I uttered a word of what had happened. Needless to say the school noticed I clearly wasn’t ok. I was cornered by my home room teacher who knew me well, I word vomitted; CPS was called. I didn’t see my brother for 5 years. For those years he was told that he and I had been play fighting and I took it too far; he never held onto this though- not fully.  \nHe had doubt. \nOnce when I was 19- and he was 15, he walked into my room (where all us youngins gather during family get togethers) where my then partner and I were talking about this- he was pressuring me to tell him. He hugged me and said “I know” I bawled my eyes out begging him not to hate dad. He said they had already talked about it and agreed they remember it differently from eachother so they don’t engage on it. \n\nI have my own history with this song… it was sung to me by my father and my mum; they didn’t do so lovingly, it was an open threat. Throughout the years it would make me panic and cry when I’d hear it. In 2021 I was in my undergrad, one of my electives was music therapy. This was one of the songs the prof selected; my whole class saw me fall apart over zoom… I had to talk about it. So I started singing it. Take its power away kind of thing? Idfk. I can sing it now with no issues, I don’t cry or get sad or panic. \nToday I sung it on FaceTime with my brother as we were just catching up quickly before going about our days…\nWhat I didn’t know or remember. \nI sang that to him that day through tears saying he’s going to be okay; except I always sung “I’ll always love you and keep you happy; you don’t need to give the same. I will love you forever, I have before I ever knew your name”. He said he had to go and immediately ended the call but I saw his face. We look similar. \nI texted him saying I love him and hope he has a good day he read it. No response. \nHis gf messaged me about an hour ago telling me that he’s okay but that he remembers that day now… the whole thing. He’s processing and to give him space. \nIdk what to do, I feel awful for not being aware or not thinking. I wish I could take it back. \nTLDR; tifu; I unlocked a memory my brother never wanted back by singing a song from our childhood.",

    "text": "TIFU by not turning off discord activity share My boyfriend and I are avid gamers and will occasionally play a naughty game together for a little added spice. Any of the games we play are set to hidden on steam and we only play them on our laptop in our bedroom. We will typically connect the laptop to the TV and use a wireless mouse or a controller depending on the game. \n\nMy boyfriend had been using the laptop for school work and had been logged into discord. He completely forgot and neither of us realized that hidden on steam didn't mean hidden on discord until we saw a notification pop up with a message from one of his childhood friends that said \"Ayooo what are you playing bro? 😂\" \n\nNaturally we finish what we are doing and then my boyfriend gets up and responds to him. He says something along the lines of \"just doing research\" \n\nHis friend replies \"so what's the occasion? Just like playing one-handed games?\" My boyfriend plays it off, and we turn off the share activity setting. He didn't want to share our business, so he never informed the friend it was a group activity, and now his friend makes little comments about my boyfriend jerking it to dirty games. \n\nThe thing is, we have been doing this for about a year now. Obviously not every time, but we do enjoy it together as a form of play and it makes me wonder how many of our mutuals have seen these games pop up on our activity and just never mentioned it. The friend that did reach out said it isn't the first time he has seen a dirty game on our activity, so I can only assume this wasn't a one-time fluke and others have definitely seen it and just not said anything. \n\nTL;DR My boyfriend and I forgot to turn off discord activity share while we played a dirty game and now everyone thinks my boyfriend jerks off to steam porn games.",

    "text": "[US] New job wants to send me \"equipment\" I got an offer for a contract job for a large well known company through a staffing agency. I did only 1 interview over Microsoft Teams video call. There were 2 interviewers and they both turned on their cameras. I saw both of their names on LinkedIn, but they didn't have profile pictures of their faces. Both of them had been with the company for years. The interview itself was fine, no fishy business there I think.\n\nA recruiter had messaged me on Indeed shortly after I updated my resume, and that's how I found out about this job. We talked on the phone, she sounded genuine, and she had a profile on LinkedIn. She had set up the interview. So about 1 hour after I finished the interview, she tried to call me and I wouldn't pick up because I was tired. Then she emailed me, asking how it went, and she asked if I could talk on the phone. I said yes, and she said they wanted to make an offer. Sounds urgent right?\n\nI told her I was leaning towards accepting, but needed some details cleared up like, how many days was I to be in office/remote? So she said she would get back to me. And she did. And we did a little more back and forth (I asked for a pay increase). Also I reached out to the interviewers to find out if their offer was legit. One of the two replied confirming, and they really wanted me to join their team. Doesn't prove much, but I figured I would try anyway.\n\nSo I get my pay increase, and I accept. The process moves along and the recruiter passes me onto the company's 3rd party onboarding/payroll company. I looked them up, seems legit. The email I received from them was from a woman who had a LinkedIn with a selfie profile picture. I got a link to complete sexual harrassment training, but they said the link expires in 48 hours. Urgency?\n\nBut now it's the onboarding person's most recent email that's worrying me. It said once I fill out the documents in this supposedly secure website, then my drug screening could be scheduled, and \"equipment\" would be shipped to me. On the day it is to be shipped to me, I will receive a call from them confirming my address. When I receive it (24-48 hrs) I need to tell the onboarding person, and finally I will be cleared to come into work on my target date.\n\nThe equipment was vaguely listed as laptop, mouse, stuff like that. Is this a scam? I haven't been asked for any money yet.",

[US] Did I get scammed or am I dumb\n\nSo i was on tiktok and I saw this daytrader and followed him for his advice. Then he followed me and asked if I wanted to join his discord group. After we talked for a bit he asked me if I wanted to do some copy trading on a private broker called “Meta Options” .\n\nI agreed and slowly over the course of a month I put in ~48k. In the end I had ~850k. I was told to initiate a withdrawal with the support team and was told I had to pay a 10% tax upfront before receiving money. I sent it to them and then they said they sent in to my robinhood account but I had never received it.\n\nI was told an error happened because of the size of the withdrawal so they told me to send my base: formerly coinbase wallet eth address.\n\nAfter I sent it I received $850k of a coin called BR2.0 . The problem is that won’t send to robinhood so the support told me to connect with someone who is a special assistant with coinbase. He walked me through the steps and seemed normal but a but sus that it was on whatsapp \n\nI had gotten an error message when I tried swapping that said “something went wrong” when I would click continue and when I told him this he said it was because My account is ineligible to carry out any of these transactions due to my account status. My account holds a significant high balance and it needs to be upgraded before I can be able to carry out my swap or withdrawal.\n\nWhen I asked how to upgrade my coinbase wallet account I was told to pay 15% of my account to a wallet the private broker would provide me and that the coinbase assistant would manually upgrade my account with 2-3 hours and then send the 15% back to me.\n\nAt this point it seemed fishy so I did my own research and saw on google, chatgpt and grok that there is no such thing as an upgraded account on coinbase wallet, let alone it needed a fee.\n\nWhen I brought this up they both said that was general info and my case didn’t pertain to that and was specific so I wouldn’t come on a google search. I also checked the coin and the price was nothing like what i was told, on coinbase wallet it says 20$ but when you check the coin on geckoterminal it says it’s $0.00832.\n\nWhen I brought this all up I was told the coin isn’t worthless it’s just looking that way because my account isn’t upgraded and I don’t have all the features unlocked.\n\nWhen I said I wasn’t paying a dime and said this was scammy I was told that they would suddenly cover some of the costs and when I still said i’m not paying anything and that I was done I was told that he understand my frustration and that another client were paid in similar coin and that there’s been no issue and that the amount I have is high and that’s the main reason and why it’s likely.\n\nThen he said he isn’t here to convince me but and will look for a better option to resolve this and will keep me posted.\n\nDid i get scammed or am I an idiot and should apologize ???",

    "text": "(US)Small justice solace after being sucked into a task scam and taken for $8k So I got taken in on a movie review task scam. It was a Telegram message randomly friendly \"job\" offer to review movies for money supposedly for Pixar. Had a website that had a pretty slick interface with lots of Pixar movie graphics and a supportive \"working group\" of about ten people giving advice and lots of encouragement to keep going (you just have to finish this set of movies and it will payout). Started with a small deposit to finish a series of 25 movie reviews, because I had gotten a \"superior film\" which put my account in the negative. In order to complete i had to deposit some of my own money (started out small, like $12) and finished the first series and it paid out like $50, cashed out and should have quit \n\n(plenty of red flags i chose to foolishly ignore, asking for only crypto currency, increasingly higher deposits), but I was getting all this encouragement from the \"working group\" that they were showing big deposits and I just kept dumping money in feeling like the return was just around the corner.\n\nI began trolling the working group and they would get defensive, saying how would Pixar be doing something fake, look at all of us, finishing and getting these big deposits, even threatened me with their \"legal department\" which of course never materialized.\n\nReported it to the BBB, did a Whois and tracked down the AliBaba web host and did a fraud report, trust pilot report and reported to Coinbase. Got the initial website taken down and they just popped up with another domain name in a day. Kept in the working group to keep tabs. Got a couple more domains shut down. \n\nStill pissed they kept popping up, so with the help of ChatGPT I've been learning how to code in Python and wrote script for my own \"scam radar\" that tracked down the source hub for all kinds of scam sites from phishing to these task scams and more, that compiles detailed reports to turn in to the web hosts, servers and IC3.\n\nI have resigned myself to the fact that ill never see my money and that these groups are too big and too sophisticated to get them permanently shut down, but I do get a little solace that I can slow them down and inconvenience them by knocking out the hub for a while, costing the money to restart and keep at least a few people from getting ripped off, and ill keep at it because im pissed and I've got $8k worth of trolling to do to be the karmic justice warrior, lol.\n\nDon't be dumb like I was, they might be pretty savvy, but if they are asking for crypto, on Telegram and WhatsApp and it sounds too good to be true, it definitely is. Stay safe out there and always be suspicious!",

I contacted their support team immediately. Initially, a representative named David asked me for extensive details to locate my account, including my full name, alternative emails, and specifically the first 6 and last 4 digits of my payment card.\n\nI provided all this information, including the specific card details they asked for. Despite this, they are now replying with generic templates claiming they \"couldn't locate the subscription\" and are asking for the same information again or suggesting I might have used a different email.\n\nI have even sent them a video recording proving that I declined the subscription/cancelled, but they are ignoring it and continuing the stalling tactics. It seems like a deliberate attempt to delay the process so they can keep the money.\n\nIf you are dealing with MyIQ :\n\n1. They will likely claim your account doesn't exist.\n2. They will ask for sensitive card info (first 6 / last 4 digits) and then ignore it.\n\nI am now proceeding with a chargeback through my bank. Has anyone else dealt with this specific support team?",

    "text": "[US] Hospital Bill Scam? TLDR:\n\nGot two calls from a 916 number about a hospital bill I never received. The voicemails were from a bot claiming to be from dignityhealth.org. When I called back, the agent sounded like an outsourced call center, asked for my DOB + address (which I gave), and told me I owe way more than what my insurance should’ve left me to pay. Later I saw that Dignity Health posted an official warning about scammers pretending to collect medical bills. Now I’m worried it might’ve been a scam and whether I’m compromised.\n\nHi everyone I’m trying to understand whether what happened to me is normal or if I just got targeted by a scam.\n\nOver the past couple of days, I received two calls from a 916 area code number. Both times, I missed the call, and each time it went to voicemail. When I checked the messages, it was a bot saying they were from dignityhealth.org and that I had a bill or statement that needed attention.\n\nFor background:\n\nA couple of months ago, I was admitted to a Dignity Health DTLA. But since being discharged, I’ve never received any bill, no statement ID, no itemized bill, nothing. So I was already confused why an automated bot was calling before any physical mail or portal notification.\n\nToday, I finally called the number back. The person who answered sounded like they were from an overseas call center. (Not trying to assume anything)\n\nShe asked for my statement ID, which I didn’t have, and then asked for my dob and address “for security purposes.” I gave those. She then told me the amount I owe, and it was way higher than the estimate I saw when I left the hospital. My oop supposed to be only 10%, but she said the insurance only covered a “small amount,” which doesn’t make sense with my plan.\n\nI asked for an itemized bill, and she said they would mail it to my address.\n\nAfter the call, I did a research and saw  a legit fb post from Dignity Health warning about a recent phone scam where scammers pretend to collect hospital bills. That’s when I started getting anxious because:\n\n\n1.\tThe voicemail came from a bot, not a real billing rep.\n2.\tI still haven’t received any physical bill or online statement.\n3.\tThe amount they quoted doesn’t match the estimated responsibility I saw at discharge.\n4.\tI gave them my DOB and address, which I’m now worried about.\n\nMy questions:\n\n• Could this have been a scam call?\n\n• If it was, how bad is it that they now have my DOB and address?\n\nI tend to get paranoid with stuff like this, but the timing with the scam alert and the weird details have me on edge. Any advice is appreciated.",

Is there anything that she can do now? The payment has already come out of her account.\n\nIt was supposed to be a Christmas present for my aunt. A relative made my grandma a social media account which was a terrible idea because she's now able to easily be advertised to by websites like this one.\n\nIt's not a large sum of money (£31.94) but it's still scummy that they're taking all these people's money and just really want to know if there's a way to get the money back in anyway.\n\nIm unable to reply to comments right now, but we have called her card provider and they said after 15 days of the purchase if no product has been received and no communication of the delivery, then they can open a dispute for the charge. Whether it will be successful or not remains to be seen.\n\nI'll definitely be having a conversation with her about this as she's only a few weeks ago had a card blocked by her bank for an unauthorised transaction from some other website she used it for.",

I couldn’t shake that the phone call felt oddly robotic even though the person on the other end of the line was really fast at responding to me, including when I asked how they were.

They told me that I applied for a loan through them, I don’t recall that I did but since I got the call anyway I thought; might as well see what is this about!\n\nAfter more research, I found out these people are NOT American. The guy who talked to me is from the middle east using a fake name even though that their website states: U.S.-based loan specialist will promptly reach out to help finalize any remaining details and answer your questions.\n\nHe asked me for a soft check of my credit, i was desperate enough to say yes. And when I checked with Transunion, apparently the name of the company was “Cash Keeper”. He told me that I didn’t qualify and directed me to a debt relief service through a company called “Swift Debt Relief”.\n\nTransunion stated the company that pulled my credit was \"Cash Keeper\" and it was through a broker called CIC Credit. I am reaching out to them after this post.\n\nlook at the names:\n\nThe call was from middle eastern “Everest Financial Solution” My credit was pulled through “Cash Keeper” And they tried bait and switch me to sell my information to “Swift Debt Relief”\n\nI told them that I need to run my own research and expecting a call back from them later today, I’ll make sure they’re aware of this post. And these are my findings:\n\nOn their website, the privacy page doesn’t have an update date for the policy, no phone number, they state that they are not direct lenders, yet they promote unsecured loans in their home page?! I mean how bad can it get? This is most likely legal under lending laws. They didn’t run me for a personal loan and refused to give me a Denial Letter per federal law too.\n\nThis is a bait and switch strategy, where they promote something and actually do something else.\n\nThis is also a fake “loan” application process.\n\nLast thing I expected was for a company like “Swift Debt Relief” to be shady enough to hire a bunch of people in the another country without any kind of security measures or protocols to deal with people’s sensitive information.\n\nThey had my first and last name, my address, email, phone number, social number, access to get a copy of my credit, and god knows what else. Aside from the fact that he had the guts to ask for my banking information where I’ll probably end up having all my life savings stolen.\n\nSwift debt relief looks like they have fake reviews on BBB and I emailed BBB regarding their accreditation as I have so many questions now.\n\nDon’t fall for their trap, i’ll make sure this a known knowledge everywhere, and will make sure no one gets scammed the way I almost did.",

    "text": "[US] Fake loan scam calling every day from a new number Hi, posting this as I haven’t seen anyone mentioning it. \n\nSince September 3rd, I have gotten 1-2 scam calls every single day telling me my loan for $62,000-$65,000 is almost approved. I have never applied for a loan and my credit is locked. \n\nThese scammers call from a different number EVERY SINGLE DAY. I cannot block them because it’s a different number, and a different area code. They leave me voicemails that are nearly 2 minutes long. I have made it so my phone automatically goes to voicemail for numbers I don’t know and they still call every day. (This was done over a month ago)\n\nI have never answered their calls until yesterday and today, where I asked them to remove me from their call list. They proceeded to continue trying their scam until I yelled at them and told them I know they’re scammers. Both times they have claimed they are removing me from the list. I will be genuinely surprised if they do. \n\nHere is the voicemail transcript they leave:\n\n“Almost approved for $64,000.  You can call us back at -number- or press one to speak with underwriting.  If you're still interested in moving forward, please press one to connect with our underwriting team.  \n\nIf you've already received your reference code or approval code, press 2 and you'll be routed directly to your assigned underwriter for assistance.  You can also log into your loan portal at any time to review your offer and select your preferred terms. If you haven't created your account yet, don't worry.  Just press one and our underwriting team will walk you through the process, help you review your documents and set up your portal access.  Please press one now to connect.  \n\nFor your reference.  This is Alan Grant calling from personal loan review.  I'm reaching out because we recently reevaluated your previous loan request, and the update is much more promising this time.  Market rates have improved and are underwriting guidelines have expanded, which means applicants who weren't eligible. for may now qualify.  Even with lower credit.  If you're still considering a personal or consolidation loan, you can call us back speak directly with underwriting.  When we reviewed your file this morning, it's showing you're almost approved for roughly $64,000.  You can also return the call at -number-“\n\nIf anyone has any tips to make these people stop, I would appreciate it. My next move is to threaten to report them to the FBI.",

The message named a real person and asked me to contact her via a private email on a non-Citi domain.\n\nThat felt off, so I did some investigating instead of replying. What I found:\n\nBurner domain\n\nThe domain used for contact was registered ONE DAY before the outreach. WHOIS showed full privacy masking and shared VPS hosting in the US. The VPS was hosting another 24 unrelated domains.\n\nExecutive impersonation\n\nThe website behind the domain copied the real executive’s name and title, her biography text from Citi’s official press release, and her portrait which I traced via reverse image search to a FinTech news article.\n\nSynthetic website (referenced in the title)\n\nThe site also contained investment fund descriptions copied word-for-word from an unrelated hedge fund’s marketing materials, indicating the site was stitched together from stolen content.\n\nSocial engineering vector\n\nThe LinkedIn message came from a recruiter profile that appears legitimate and long-standing, but whose role and geography had no connection to investment banking. This suggests possible account compromise or misuse rather than a fake profile.\n\nConclusion?\n\nThis appears to be a coordinated executive impersonation scam combining a real, recently promoted executive identity, a just-in-time registered domain, plagiarised investment content, and LinkedIn social engineering to move targets off-platform.\n\nI reported it to Citi via their official phishing channel.\n\nSharing mainly as an example of how scams are evolving. Especially the use of real executives and legitimate-looking LinkedIn accounts.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

This is my personal story, not a legal claim, just a cautionary note for others.\n\nI found them on Google as I needed some help with one of my clients sites, found Flumberico, first requested a free audit , a bit later I was contacted by \\[redacted, the CEO\\]. The audit itself seemed useful, site speed was slow, mobile UX issues, some content out of place, plus notes on titles and other optimizations. Everything made sense, so I trusted them enough to join their trial and entered my credit card information on their site.\n\nThat’s when things went wrong. I noticed unexpected charges: $197 for an “intro call” and $840 for “working hours.” There was no clear breakdown, no prior agreement explaining these fees. It felt like they could bill whatever they wanted. I still don't know how that happened but I got my brother to cancel it for me now in my banking app / Stripe account.\n\nLooking deeper now,, I also realized there’s no transparency about where they’re actually based, no business license or other identifiers, nothing to verify their legitimacy. The website mentions New York City, but that’s it, no verifiable footprint, no reviews, no other presence.\n\nI’m posting this to warn anyone considering Flumberico. Always check credentials and confirm terms before handing over payment, no matter how convincing the audit or initial conversation may seem.",

[US] Did I get scammed or am I dumb\n\nSo i was on tiktok and I saw this daytrader and followed him for his advice. Then he followed me and asked if I wanted to join his discord group. After we talked for a bit he asked me if I wanted to do some copy trading on a private broker called “Meta Options” .\n\nI agreed and slowly over the course of a month I put in ~48k. In the end I had ~850k. I was told to initiate a withdrawal with the support team and was told I had to pay a 10% tax upfront before receiving money. I sent it to them and then they said they sent in to my robinhood account but I had never received it.\n\nI was told an error happened because of the size of the withdrawal so they told me to send my base: formerly coinbase wallet eth address.\n\nAfter I sent it I received $850k of a coin called BR2.0 . The problem is that won’t send to robinhood so the support told me to connect with someone who is a special assistant with coinbase. He walked me through the steps and seemed normal but a but sus that it was on whatsapp \n\nI had gotten an error message when I tried swapping that said “something went wrong” when I would click continue and when I told him this he said it was because My account is ineligible to carry out any of these transactions due to my account status. My account holds a significant high balance and it needs to be upgraded before I can be able to carry out my swap or withdrawal.\n\nWhen I asked how to upgrade my coinbase wallet account I was told to pay 15% of my account to a wallet the private broker would provide me and that the coinbase assistant would manually upgrade my account with 2-3 hours and then send the 15% back to me.\n\nAt this point it seemed fishy so I did my own research and saw on google, chatgpt and grok that there is no such thing as an upgraded account on coinbase wallet, let alone it needed a fee.\n\nWhen I brought this up they both said that was general info and my case didn’t pertain to that and was specific so I wouldn’t come on a google search. I also checked the coin and the price was nothing like what i was told, on coinbase wallet it says 20$ but when you check the coin on geckoterminal it says it’s $0.00832.\n\nWhen I brought this all up I was told the coin isn’t worthless it’s just looking that way because my account isn’t upgraded and I don’t have all the features unlocked.\n\nWhen I said I wasn’t paying a dime and said this was scammy I was told that they would suddenly cover some of the costs and when I still said i’m not paying anything and that I was done I was told that he understand my frustration and that another client were paid in similar coin and that there’s been no issue and that the amount I have is high and that’s the main reason and why it’s likely.\n\nThen he said he isn’t here to convince me but and will look for a better option to resolve this and will keep me posted.\n\nDid i get scammed or am I an idiot and should apologize ???",

What I found:\n\nBurner domain\n\nThe domain used for contact was registered ONE DAY before the outreach. WHOIS showed full privacy masking and shared VPS hosting in the US. The VPS was hosting another 24 unrelated domains.\n\nExecutive impersonation\n\nThe website behind the domain copied the real executive’s name and title, her biography text from Citi’s official press release, and her portrait which I traced via reverse image search to a FinTech news article.\n\nSynthetic website (referenced in the title)\n\nThe site also contained investment fund descriptions copied word-for-word from an unrelated hedge fund’s marketing materials, indicating the site was stitched together from stolen content.\n\nSocial engineering vector\n\nThe LinkedIn message came from a recruiter profile that appears legitimate and long-standing, but whose role and geography had no connection to investment banking. This suggests possible account compromise or misuse rather than a fake profile.\n\nConclusion?\n\nThis appears to be a coordinated executive impersonation scam combining a real, recently promoted executive identity, a just-in-time registered domain, plagiarised investment content, and LinkedIn social engineering to move targets off-platform.\n\nI reported it to Citi via their official phishing channel.\n\nSharing mainly as an example of how scams are evolving. Especially the use of real executives and legitimate-looking LinkedIn accounts.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

    "text": "[US] Hospital Bill Scam? TLDR:\n\nGot two calls from a 916 number about a hospital bill I never received. The voicemails were from a bot claiming to be from dignityhealth.org. When I called back, the agent sounded like an outsourced call center, asked for my DOB + address (which I gave), and told me I owe way more than what my insurance should’ve left me to pay. Later I saw that Dignity Health posted an official warning about scammers pretending to collect medical bills. Now I’m worried it might’ve been a scam and whether I’m compromised.\n\nHi everyone I’m trying to understand whether what happened to me is normal or if I just got targeted by a scam.\n\nOver the past couple of days, I received two calls from a 916 area code number. Both times, I missed the call, and each time it went to voicemail. When I checked the messages, it was a bot saying they were from dignityhealth.org and that I had a bill or statement that needed attention.\n\nFor background:\n\nA couple of months ago, I was admitted to a Dignity Health DTLA. But since being discharged, I’ve never received any bill, no statement ID, no itemized bill, nothing. So I was already confused why an automated bot was calling before any physical mail or portal notification.\n\nToday, I finally called the number back. The person who answered sounded like they were from an overseas call center. (Not trying to assume anything)\n\nShe asked for my statement ID, which I didn’t have, and then asked for my dob and address “for security purposes.” I gave those. She then told me the amount I owe, and it was way higher than the estimate I saw when I left the hospital. My oop supposed to be only 10%, but she said the insurance only covered a “small amount,” which doesn’t make sense with my plan.\n\nI asked for an itemized bill, and she said they would mail it to my address.\n\nAfter the call, I did a research and saw  a legit fb post from Dignity Health warning about a recent phone scam where scammers pretend to collect hospital bills. That’s when I started getting anxious because:\n\n\n1.\tThe voicemail came from a bot, not a real billing rep.\n2.\tI still haven’t received any physical bill or online statement.\n3.\tThe amount they quoted doesn’t match the estimated responsibility I saw at discharge.\n4.\tI gave them my DOB and address, which I’m now worried about.\n\nMy questions:\n\n• Could this have been a scam call?\n\n• If it was, how bad is it that they now have my DOB and address?\n\nI tend to get paranoid with stuff like this, but the timing with the scam alert and the weird details have me on edge. Any advice is appreciated.",

They told me that I applied for a loan through them, I don’t recall that I did but since I got the call anyway I thought; might as well see what is this about!\n\nAfter more research, I found out these people are NOT American. The guy who talked to me is from the middle east using a fake name even though that their website states: U.S.-based loan specialist will promptly reach out to help finalize any remaining details and answer your questions.\n\nHe asked me for a soft check of my credit, i was desperate enough to say yes. And when I checked with Transunion, apparently the name of the company was “Cash Keeper”. He told me that I didn’t qualify and directed me to a debt relief service through a company called “Swift Debt Relief”.\n\nTransunion stated the company that pulled my credit was \"Cash Keeper\" and it was through a broker called CIC Credit. I am reaching out to them after this post.\n\nlook at the names:\n\nThe call was from middle eastern “Everest Financial Solution” My credit was pulled through “Cash Keeper” And they tried bait and switch me to sell my information to “Swift Debt Relief”\n\nI told them that I need to run my own research and expecting a call back from them later today, I’ll make sure they’re aware of this post. And these are my findings:\n\nOn their website, the privacy page doesn’t have an update date for the policy, no phone number, they state that they are not direct lenders, yet they promote unsecured loans in their home page?! I mean how bad can it get? This is most likely legal under lending laws. They didn’t run me for a personal loan and refused to give me a Denial Letter per federal law too.\n\nThis is a bait and switch strategy, where they promote something and actually do something else.\n\nThis is also a fake “loan” application process.\n\nLast thing I expected was for a company like “Swift Debt Relief” to be shady enough to hire a bunch of people in the another country without any kind of security measures or protocols to deal with people’s sensitive information.\n\nThey had my first and last name, my address, email, phone number, social number, access to get a copy of my credit, and god knows what else. Aside from the fact that he had the guts to ask for my banking information where I’ll probably end up having all my life savings stolen.\n\nSwift debt relief looks like they have fake reviews on BBB and I emailed BBB regarding their accreditation as I have so many questions now.\n\nDon’t fall for their trap, i’ll make sure this a known knowledge everywhere, and will make sure no one gets scammed the way I almost did.",

In order to complete i had to deposit some of my own money (started out small, like $12) and finished the first series and it paid out like $50, cashed out and should have quit \n\n(plenty of red flags i chose to foolishly ignore, asking for only crypto currency, increasingly higher deposits), but I was getting all this encouragement from the \"working group\" that they were showing big deposits and I just kept dumping money in feeling like the return was just around the corner.\n\nI began trolling the working group and they would get defensive, saying how would Pixar be doing something fake, look at all of us, finishing and getting these big deposits, even threatened me with their \"legal department\" which of course never materialized.\n\nReported it to the BBB, did a Whois and tracked down the AliBaba web host and did a fraud report, trust pilot report and reported to Coinbase. Got the initial website taken down and they just popped up with another domain name in a day. Kept in the working group to keep tabs. Got a couple more domains shut down. \n\nStill pissed they kept popping up, so with the help of ChatGPT I've been learning how to code in Python and wrote script for my own \"scam radar\" that tracked down the source hub for all kinds of scam sites from phishing to these task scams and more, that compiles detailed reports to turn in to the web hosts, servers and IC3.\n\nI have resigned myself to the fact that ill never see my money and that these groups are too big and too sophisticated to get them permanently shut down, but I do get a little solace that I can slow them down and inconvenience them by knocking out the hub for a while, costing the money to restart and keep at least a few people from getting ripped off, and ill keep at it because im pissed and I've got $8k worth of trolling to do to be the karmic justice warrior, lol.\n\nDon't be dumb like I was, they might be pretty savvy, but if they are asking for crypto, on Telegram and WhatsApp and it sounds too good to be true, it definitely is. Stay safe out there and always be suspicious!",

    "text": "Research article analyzing Reddit discussion about scams TL;DR: We wrote an article about Reddit discussion about scams, including on r/Scams . Read it for free here: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3765030](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3765030).\n\nHi everyone! I’m Elijah Bouma-Sims, a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on understanding why people fall victim to online scams and exploring ways to prevent such crimes.\n\nI am writing to share a recent article I wrote, focused on Reddit discussion about scams. This paper analyzes about 1,500 posts from four Reddit communities where people discuss scams. Most of the posts came from r/Scams. Our goals were to understand the types of scams people discuss, the types of support people seek, and the types of advice people receive in response.\n\nFrom the analysis, we found that Reddit plays a meaningful role in scam prevention and remediation. Community members help posters identify scams and offer advice to recent victims, including emotional support and guidance. We also observed patterns in the types of scams people report, as well as how scammers sometimes attempt to target posters directly. We further discuss how moderators and community members work to prevent revictimization.\n\nOf particular relevance to r/Scams is that we found posters were more likely to be shamed or chastised compared to those on r/Sextortion. This issue should not be overstated, as these comments represented a small minority of contributions (and are basically inevitable on the internet). Still, I believe it is worth noting.\n\nIf you're interested in reading more, the paper is available here for free:  \n[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3765030](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3765030). I apologize that this is fairly dense and academic, but I hope these findings are helpful to moderators and community members.",

They further stated that documentation had been sent to me several times via 2 (unused) email addresses and US mail sent to a FL address and my current address (in VA) but I have never received anything.\n\nHere's the problem, I haven't lived in FL since 3/2018. This debt is in no way mine. I'm not sure this debt even exists, because, prior to creating this post, I searched the sub and found [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1c6l330/i_got_called_by_a_debt_collector/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) from 2 years ago from someone who posted the EXACT SAME info.\n\nI can't find a record of \"QuickCash Loans\" as a business, and I never took out a payday loan from an online lender. When I DID take out payday loans, they were always in brick-and-mortar loan offices.\n\nI did a reverse phone lookup for the phone number they're calling from and there are no records. None of the searches found a person or business that phone number is tied to. To add to the potential scammy-ness of it, they stated that this loan/collection account was never posted to my credit report (which is accurate) but will now be reported \"in the next 24-48 hours.\"\n\nIs this a known scam or zombie debt? If not, how should I handle this?",

I have never applied for a loan and my credit is locked. \n\nThese scammers call from a different number EVERY SINGLE DAY. I cannot block them because it’s a different number, and a different area code. They leave me voicemails that are nearly 2 minutes long. I have made it so my phone automatically goes to voicemail for numbers I don’t know and they still call every day. (This was done over a month ago)\n\nI have never answered their calls until yesterday and today, where I asked them to remove me from their call list. They proceeded to continue trying their scam until I yelled at them and told them I know they’re scammers. Both times they have claimed they are removing me from the list. I will be genuinely surprised if they do. \n\nHere is the voicemail transcript they leave:\n\n“Almost approved for $64,000.  You can call us back at -number- or press one to speak with underwriting.  If you're still interested in moving forward, please press one to connect with our underwriting team.  \n\nIf you've already received your reference code or approval code, press 2 and you'll be routed directly to your assigned underwriter for assistance.  You can also log into your loan portal at any time to review your offer and select your preferred terms. If you haven't created your account yet, don't worry.  Just press one and our underwriting team will walk you through the process, help you review your documents and set up your portal access.  Please press one now to connect.  \n\nFor your reference.  This is Alan Grant calling from personal loan review.  I'm reaching out because we recently reevaluated your previous loan request, and the update is much more promising this time.  Market rates have improved and are underwriting guidelines have expanded, which means applicants who weren't eligible. for may now qualify.  Even with lower credit.  If you're still considering a personal or consolidation loan, you can call us back speak directly with underwriting.  When we reviewed your file this morning, it's showing you're almost approved for roughly $64,000.  You can also return the call at -number-“\n\nIf anyone has any tips to make these people stop, I would appreciate it. My next move is to threaten to report them to the FBI.",

I am guessing the presumed payment is done, then retracted a day later, then buyer informs the seller that he/she has changed their mind, and demand a refund of the payment, and that is when the seller sends real money to the buyer.  Is this how it works?",

    "text": "[US] New job wants to send me \"equipment\" I got an offer for a contract job for a large well known company through a staffing agency. I did only 1 interview over Microsoft Teams video call. There were 2 interviewers and they both turned on their cameras. I saw both of their names on LinkedIn, but they didn't have profile pictures of their faces. Both of them had been with the company for years. The interview itself was fine, no fishy business there I think.\n\nA recruiter had messaged me on Indeed shortly after I updated my resume, and that's how I found out about this job. We talked on the phone, she sounded genuine, and she had a profile on LinkedIn. She had set up the interview. So about 1 hour after I finished the interview, she tried to call me and I wouldn't pick up because I was tired. Then she emailed me, asking how it went, and she asked if I could talk on the phone. I said yes, and she said they wanted to make an offer. Sounds urgent right?\n\nI told her I was leaning towards accepting, but needed some details cleared up like, how many days was I to be in office/remote? So she said she would get back to me. And she did. And we did a little more back and forth (I asked for a pay increase). Also I reached out to the interviewers to find out if their offer was legit. One of the two replied confirming, and they really wanted me to join their team. Doesn't prove much, but I figured I would try anyway.\n\nSo I get my pay increase, and I accept. The process moves along and the recruiter passes me onto the company's 3rd party onboarding/payroll company. I looked them up, seems legit. The email I received from them was from a woman who had a LinkedIn with a selfie profile picture. I got a link to complete sexual harrassment training, but they said the link expires in 48 hours. Urgency?\n\nBut now it's the onboarding person's most recent email that's worrying me. It said once I fill out the documents in this supposedly secure website, then my drug screening could be scheduled, and \"equipment\" would be shipped to me. On the day it is to be shipped to me, I will receive a call from them confirming my address. When I receive it (24-48 hrs) I need to tell the onboarding person, and finally I will be cleared to come into work on my target date.\n\nThe equipment was vaguely listed as laptop, mouse, stuff like that. Is this a scam? I haven't been asked for any money yet.",

[US] Did I get scammed or am I dumb\n\nSo i was on tiktok and I saw this daytrader and followed him for his advice. Then he followed me and asked if I wanted to join his discord group. After we talked for a bit he asked me if I wanted to do some copy trading on a private broker called “Meta Options” .\n\nI agreed and slowly over the course of a month I put in ~48k. In the end I had ~850k. I was told to initiate a withdrawal with the support team and was told I had to pay a 10% tax upfront before receiving money. I sent it to them and then they said they sent in to my robinhood account but I had never received it.\n\nI was told an error happened because of the size of the withdrawal so they told me to send my base: formerly coinbase wallet eth address.\n\nAfter I sent it I received $850k of a coin called BR2.0 . The problem is that won’t send to robinhood so the support told me to connect with someone who is a special assistant with coinbase. He walked me through the steps and seemed normal but a but sus that it was on whatsapp \n\nI had gotten an error message when I tried swapping that said “something went wrong” when I would click continue and when I told him this he said it was because My account is ineligible to carry out any of these transactions due to my account status. My account holds a significant high balance and it needs to be upgraded before I can be able to carry out my swap or withdrawal.\n\nWhen I asked how to upgrade my coinbase wallet account I was told to pay 15% of my account to a wallet the private broker would provide me and that the coinbase assistant would manually upgrade my account with 2-3 hours and then send the 15% back to me.\n\nAt this point it seemed fishy so I did my own research and saw on google, chatgpt and grok that there is no such thing as an upgraded account on coinbase wallet, let alone it needed a fee.\n\nWhen I brought this up they both said that was general info and my case didn’t pertain to that and was specific so I wouldn’t come on a google search. I also checked the coin and the price was nothing like what i was told, on coinbase wallet it says 20$ but when you check the coin on geckoterminal it says it’s $0.00832.\n\nWhen I brought this all up I was told the coin isn’t worthless it’s just looking that way because my account isn’t upgraded and I don’t have all the features unlocked.\n\nWhen I said I wasn’t paying a dime and said this was scammy I was told that they would suddenly cover some of the costs and when I still said i’m not paying anything and that I was done I was told that he understand my frustration and that another client were paid in similar coin and that there’s been no issue and that the amount I have is high and that’s the main reason and why it’s likely.\n\nThen he said he isn’t here to convince me but and will look for a better option to resolve this and will keep me posted.\n\nDid i get scammed or am I an idiot and should apologize ???",

The message named a real person and asked me to contact her via a private email on a non-Citi domain.\n\nThat felt off, so I did some investigating instead of replying. What I found:\n\nBurner domain\n\nThe domain used for contact was registered ONE DAY before the outreach. WHOIS showed full privacy masking and shared VPS hosting in the US. The VPS was hosting another 24 unrelated domains.\n\nExecutive impersonation\n\nThe website behind the domain copied the real executive’s name and title, her biography text from Citi’s official press release, and her portrait which I traced via reverse image search to a FinTech news article.\n\nSynthetic website (referenced in the title)\n\nThe site also contained investment fund descriptions copied word-for-word from an unrelated hedge fund’s marketing materials, indicating the site was stitched together from stolen content.\n\nSocial engineering vector\n\nThe LinkedIn message came from a recruiter profile that appears legitimate and long-standing, but whose role and geography had no connection to investment banking. This suggests possible account compromise or misuse rather than a fake profile.\n\nConclusion?\n\nThis appears to be a coordinated executive impersonation scam combining a real, recently promoted executive identity, a just-in-time registered domain, plagiarised investment content, and LinkedIn social engineering to move targets off-platform.\n\nI reported it to Citi via their official phishing channel.\n\nSharing mainly as an example of how scams are evolving.

After I told her, she suddenly had *exactly* those types of offers in *exactly* the range I gave her - which already felt suspicious.\n\nThen I tried to look up the company she says she works for. **There is absolutely no trace of it online,** not even a basic website. When I asked for their site, she gave me a link ending in `.app` instead of `.com` or any other legitimate-looking domain, which felt like another red flag.\n\nI also asked if at any point they expect any fee from me, and she strongly denied it.  \nThey now want my CV, cover letter, and references/testimonials from previous clients.\n\nI’m trying to understand what the scam here might be - data harvesting? identity theft? Or is there any chance this could still be legit?\n\nTo make it weirder, their email is a Gmail address, and when I asked her to connect on LinkedIn, she said her LinkedIn is “temporarily blocked due to high activity.”\n\nHas anyone seen something like this before?",

I don't know if venting is allowed here, but I need somewhere to let this out and I can't let it out at her.\n\nShe's been looking for a job, because things are tight as fuck right now and the money is needed. And because of her disability, she needs one that she can do from home.\n\nWell, she apparently found something, and I happened to notice that it involved crypto. So I immediately started asking the relevant questions and giving the relevant warnings, most of which boiled down to \"if they want money for anything, no matter how little the amount is, ***stop*** and walk away.\"\n\nShe assured me that she was aware, that she would bounce the minute that payment *from* her came up. And because she's a grown-ass adult and doesn't need me nagging in her ear constantly about stuff, I left it that.\n\nToday, guess what she tells me? That she sent them money. It wasn't much, less than $50 (not that she can really afford that right now either), but they immediately come back with \"well now you need to send us this much more,\" and the fucking penny finally dropped.\n\nShe tells me, when I asked why she did that after I warned her and she acknowledged those warnings, that she \"wanted to hope.\" I had to bite down so fucking hard on the urge to start screaming at her. Because that's exactly what these subhumans use to get that money, that fucking ***hope***. That fucking hope that this one time, it's not the scam that it so definitely is. They played her like a fucking cheap fiddle, and she handed them the fucking bow herself, after I told her to pay attention and do precisely **NOT** that very thing.\n\nAnd the worst part of this, the very worst part, is that now I don't trust her not to do it again. She's told me that she won't, that'll she more wary of such supposed opportunities, and that she won't let her hope and desperation override her good sense.\n\nBut I don't believe her. Because I believed her when she acknowledged my warnings about this and then she still gave up some of her money.",

    "text": "[US] Hospital Bill Scam? TLDR:\n\nGot two calls from a 916 number about a hospital bill I never received. The voicemails were from a bot claiming to be from dignityhealth.org. When I called back, the agent sounded like an outsourced call center, asked for my DOB + address (which I gave), and told me I owe way more than what my insurance should’ve left me to pay. Later I saw that Dignity Health posted an official warning about scammers pretending to collect medical bills. Now I’m worried it might’ve been a scam and whether I’m compromised.\n\nHi everyone I’m trying to understand whether what happened to me is normal or if I just got targeted by a scam.\n\nOver the past couple of days, I received two calls from a 916 area code number. Both times, I missed the call, and each time it went to voicemail. When I checked the messages, it was a bot saying they were from dignityhealth.org and that I had a bill or statement that needed attention.\n\nFor background:\n\nA couple of months ago, I was admitted to a Dignity Health DTLA. But since being discharged, I’ve never received any bill, no statement ID, no itemized bill, nothing. So I was already confused why an automated bot was calling before any physical mail or portal notification.\n\nToday, I finally called the number back. The person who answered sounded like they were from an overseas call center. (Not trying to assume anything)\n\nShe asked for my statement ID, which I didn’t have, and then asked for my dob and address “for security purposes.” I gave those. She then told me the amount I owe, and it was way higher than the estimate I saw when I left the hospital. My oop supposed to be only 10%, but she said the insurance only covered a “small amount,” which doesn’t make sense with my plan.\n\nI asked for an itemized bill, and she said they would mail it to my address.\n\nAfter the call, I did a research and saw  a legit fb post from Dignity Health warning about a recent phone scam where scammers pretend to collect hospital bills. That’s when I started getting anxious because:\n\n\n1.\tThe voicemail came from a bot, not a real billing rep.\n2.\tI still haven’t received any physical bill or online statement.\n3.\tThe amount they quoted doesn’t match the estimated responsibility I saw at discharge.\n4.\tI gave them my DOB and address, which I’m now worried about.\n\nMy questions:\n\n• Could this have been a scam call?\n\n• If it was, how bad is it that they now have my DOB and address?\n\nI tend to get paranoid with stuff like this, but the timing with the scam alert and the weird details have me on edge. Any advice is appreciated.",

They told me that I applied for a loan through them, I don’t recall that I did but since I got the call anyway I thought; might as well see what is this about!\n\nAfter more research, I found out these people are NOT American. The guy who talked to me is from the middle east using a fake name even though that their website states: U.S.-based loan specialist will promptly reach out to help finalize any remaining details and answer your questions.\n\nHe asked me for a soft check of my credit, i was desperate enough to say yes. And when I checked with Transunion, apparently the name of the company was “Cash Keeper”. He told me that I didn’t qualify and directed me to a debt relief service through a company called “Swift Debt Relief”.\n\nTransunion stated the company that pulled my credit was \"Cash Keeper\" and it was through a broker called CIC Credit. I am reaching out to them after this post.\n\nlook at the names:\n\nThe call was from middle eastern “Everest Financial Solution” My credit was pulled through “Cash Keeper” And they tried bait and switch me to sell my information to “Swift Debt Relief”\n\nI told them that I need to run my own research and expecting a call back from them later today, I’ll make sure they’re aware of this post. And these are my findings:\n\nOn their website, the privacy page doesn’t have an update date for the policy, no phone number, they state that they are not direct lenders, yet they promote unsecured loans in their home page?! I mean how bad can it get? This is most likely legal under lending laws. They didn’t run me for a personal loan and refused to give me a Denial Letter per federal law too.\n\nThis is a bait and switch strategy, where they promote something and actually do something else.\n\nThis is also a fake “loan” application process.\n\nLast thing I expected was for a company like “Swift Debt Relief” to be shady enough to hire a bunch of people in the another country without any kind of security measures or protocols to deal with people’s sensitive information.\n\nThey had my first and last name, my address, email, phone number, social number, access to get a copy of my credit, and god knows what else. Aside from the fact that he had the guts to ask for my banking information where I’ll probably end up having all my life savings stolen.\n\nSwift debt relief looks like they have fake reviews on BBB and I emailed BBB regarding their accreditation as I have so many questions now.\n\nDon’t fall for their trap, i’ll make sure this a known knowledge everywhere, and will make sure no one gets scammed the way I almost did.",

    "text": "Am I falling for an art commission scam? Okay, I’ve tried to investigate this myself and I’m honestly not sure what to think, so I’d like to hear some outside opinions before I get myself in any deeper.\n\nI’m a writer on AO3, and I’m currently working on the final installment of a trilogy with a modest following. Now, I’ve gotten solicitations for art commissions before, and the scammy ones are usually pretty easy to sniff out (e.g. generic “Oh, your writing is so moving, we should collab!” etc.). I always ignore these messages and I usually find they’ve been deleted from my comment section within a day.\n\nWell, a couple of weeks ago, a user commented on my story, seemed to like it, asked specific questions about the characters and theme, and then suggested we move our conversation to instagram. We do, and we chatted back and forth for a few days. Not necessarily all about my story, mostly stuff like “Hey, what’s the weather like where you are?” and “What did you do today?” Responses were never immediate and sometimes we went a day or two without speaking.\n\nA few days ago, a different user comments on my story in AO3. She also seems to have actually read my story, enjoyed it, asked questions about it, and then asked if we could continue the conversation on Discord. I link up with her there, and pretty quickly she brings up that she’s a digital artist and she would like to make some illustrations for my story. Immediately I think, “Okay, she really only wanted to connect to pitch this art thing, but fine, whatever, at least it seems like she went through the effort of actually reading my story before she reached out, so I’ll hear her out.”\n\nI ask about rates and she suggests discussing what it is I’m looking for before she gives me a quote. We discuss style, mood, character descriptions, poses, and so on. Then she asks me what price range I’m comfortable with. I‘ve never commissioned are before, so I throw out an embarrassing low-ball (it’s Christmas, I can’t afford a lot). She awkwardly but kindly informs me that she normally charges $200 USD per character but that for me she’ll knock it down to $100 per character, so since my commission is for four characters on a simple background, the price tag will be $450 USD. That’s a lot more than I was expecting, but I figured, “Well, it’s her livelihood and real artists deserve to be compensated appropriately.” We agree on a payment plan and I make my first deposit of $125 USD through the Wise app. She chats with me a few times after that, nothing related to art, just general “Hey, how’s your day going?” that kind of thing.\n\nA few days later, the first user I’d been chatting with on instagram says she had some ideas for illustrations for my story, and proceeds to describe a couple scenes from one of the chapters, including the kind of emotion they would evoke and everything. It sounds lovely, I explain I’m already commissioning another artist so I can’t afford much. With a Christmas discount she’s giving me, the price tag would be another $400 USD for two half-body characters. I say I definitely can’t afford any deposits before Christmas so I would have to wait until the New Year before I could pay for any more art. I tell her I understand if that means I won’t be eligible for her discount, but she tells me that’s fine, I can lock in the price if I make a deposit of $20 USD now. I can afford that so I make the deposit by etransfer.\n\nHere’s where the first red flag pops up. I notice that the email she gave me for the etransfer has the same name as the Wise account that I paid the other artist through. I fire off a message to both (the one on Instagram and the one on Discord) and ask if they’re the same person. They both claim no, they’re not. So I ask why do you have the same email then? They both say something about a merchant account (one of them actually refers to the account holder as her “friend”), basically the merchant collects payment for them and then gets a percentage of whatever they’re paid. This sounds extremely strange to me and I start to get suspicious.\n\nPossible Red Flag #2?: I do everything but straight up accuse them both of trying to scam me. Both of them say things like “Yeah, art scammers suck, you gotta be careful,” without really addressing my somewhat intense interrogations. I flat out ask them both what kind of assurance do I have that they’re both legit and I’m not falling for the world’s most elaborate scam? They both respond that I can trust them and they’ll do whatever it takes to set my mind at ease, which seems so evasive that ironically it has the opposite effect. I will admit that the one I was chatting with the longest seemed the tiniest bit offended (not defensive, just confused as to why I was suddenly doubting her).\n\nI asked the only I had already paid $125 to if she could provide me with progress shots of the art we discussed, and she told me she was already working on it and could send me shots of the line work within the next 3 days. That set my mind at ease a little. The other one volunteered to show me her portfolio, which included two finished works and one WIP. The art style looked pretty consistent, I didn’t see any obvious AI markers, and when I did a reverse image search they didn’t pop up anywhere else. That set me at ease even more.\n\nRed Flag #3: During this back and forth I returned to my AO3 comments to see if there were any other red flags I might have missed. Both of my comment threads with each artist have been deleted - the originals and all my replies. It’s as if the AO3 accounts they were posting from were deleted entirely. On top of that, the one with the Instagram account has no posts, only one reshare, is following 3 people and has only one follower (me), almost as if it’s a throwaway account. So needless to say, I’m feeling uneasy again.\n\nIs it normal for two different artists to use the same “merchant account” for commission payments? Maybe I’m just older don’t understand the ins and outs of e-tail, but it just seems super sus to me. I’m usually good at spotting scams, and it’s scary to think con artists have become so sophisticated that they can really come across as legit when they’re not.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I’d like to hear some outside opinions because if this really is a scam I obviously want to cut my losses before I lose any more money.\n\nTL;DR - I was approached by two different artists on AO3 for art commissions, and they both have the same “merchant email” despite claiming to be two different people. Am I being scammed?",

Seemed normal and I went ahead and parked until a elderly lady approached out of nowhere, she was asking for money and I didn’t even hesitate, I was in a happy mood and felt jolly and gave her like everything in my wallet (10$) I had previously left the house with 100 dollars which was given to me by my grandma to by her stuff, once I had given her my wallet money she asked me If I could go buy her diapers for grandkids she was supposly taking care of which I kinda find it hard to believe, she had multiple times preached god after I agreed on doing so knowing I had a lot to spare, and I had no problem with it.\n\nShe then picked out hot pockets(15$) saying the kids would like it and then the diapers which were 30$, s, after I had payed at the register she thanked me again and said do you have a extra 40$ for a hotel she was staying at with the grandkids, and I said yeah but I then stated this was my grandmas money and I needed some to buy her some groceries, and that’s when she started pressuring me and made me go to the instore atm saying “follow me” and she just expected me to do it, and I was shocked I was like I didn’t even have my card at the time.\nAnd she said if I had a spared 40$ but that would take much of everything I had and leave me with no money from the tax I had payed for her stuff already, she kept saying please, I was just, I don’t know… I gave her the 40$ and she asked for another 20 and I said I only have 10$ left and she still kept asking for more after prompting me to follow her out the store, and I just went back to my car, frustrated If It was a scam or not.\n\nI had never given any stranger that amount of money before let alone the guilt because of it being my grandmother money, I felt so bad because me and family had our own struggles at home, and this was post divorce of my parents, I tried to brush it off by initially telling myself I had a home to go to and a bed to sleep on and thinking she wasn’t so blessed, again I still felt some sorta hatred in my heart, knowing I was kind at first and it kinda felt like I was being taken advantage of.\nAfter all that I just went to the store and used my 10 dollars left and the little cash balance on my card (12$) to buy atleast some of what my grandma had needed, I feel ashamed. Also after I had bought her the diaper she had told me her daughter had died on a highway, the assumed mother of the grandkids she was taking care of.",

This is my personal story, not a legal claim, just a cautionary note for others.\n\nI found them on Google as I needed some help with one of my clients sites, found Flumberico, first requested a free audit , a bit later I was contacted by \\[redacted, the CEO\\]. The audit itself seemed useful, site speed was slow, mobile UX issues, some content out of place, plus notes on titles and other optimizations. Everything made sense, so I trusted them enough to join their trial and entered my credit card information on their site.\n\nThat’s when things went wrong. I noticed unexpected charges: $197 for an “intro call” and $840 for “working hours.” There was no clear breakdown, no prior agreement explaining these fees. It felt like they could bill whatever they wanted. I still don't know how that happened but I got my brother to cancel it for me now in my banking app / Stripe account.\n\nLooking deeper now,, I also realized there’s no transparency about where they’re actually based, no business license or other identifiers, nothing to verify their legitimacy. The website mentions New York City, but that’s it, no verifiable footprint, no reviews, no other presence.\n\nI’m posting this to warn anyone considering Flumberico. Always check credentials and confirm terms before handing over payment, no matter how convincing the audit or initial conversation may seem.",

I have never applied for a loan and my credit is locked. \n\nThese scammers call from a different number EVERY SINGLE DAY. I cannot block them because it’s a different number, and a different area code. They leave me voicemails that are nearly 2 minutes long. I have made it so my phone automatically goes to voicemail for numbers I don’t know and they still call every day. (This was done over a month ago)\n\nI have never answered their calls until yesterday and today, where I asked them to remove me from their call list. They proceeded to continue trying their scam until I yelled at them and told them I know they’re scammers. Both times they have claimed they are removing me from the list. I will be genuinely surprised if they do. \n\nHere is the voicemail transcript they leave:\n\n“Almost approved for $64,000.  You can call us back at -number- or press one to speak with underwriting.  If you're still interested in moving forward, please press one to connect with our underwriting team.  \n\nIf you've already received your reference code or approval code, press 2 and you'll be routed directly to your assigned underwriter for assistance.  You can also log into your loan portal at any time to review your offer and select your preferred terms. If you haven't created your account yet, don't worry.  Just press one and our underwriting team will walk you through the process, help you review your documents and set up your portal access.  Please press one now to connect.  \n\nFor your reference.  This is Alan Grant calling from personal loan review.  I'm reaching out because we recently reevaluated your previous loan request, and the update is much more promising this time.  Market rates have improved and are underwriting guidelines have expanded, which means applicants who weren't eligible. for may now qualify.  Even with lower credit.  If you're still considering a personal or consolidation loan, you can call us back speak directly with underwriting.  When we reviewed your file this morning, it's showing you're almost approved for roughly $64,000.  You can also return the call at -number-“\n\nIf anyone has any tips to make these people stop, I would appreciate it. My next move is to threaten to report them to the FBI.",

    "text": "[US] New job wants to send me \"equipment\" I got an offer for a contract job for a large well known company through a staffing agency. I did only 1 interview over Microsoft Teams video call. There were 2 interviewers and they both turned on their cameras. I saw both of their names on LinkedIn, but they didn't have profile pictures of their faces. Both of them had been with the company for years. The interview itself was fine, no fishy business there I think.\n\nA recruiter had messaged me on Indeed shortly after I updated my resume, and that's how I found out about this job. We talked on the phone, she sounded genuine, and she had a profile on LinkedIn. She had set up the interview. So about 1 hour after I finished the interview, she tried to call me and I wouldn't pick up because I was tired. Then she emailed me, asking how it went, and she asked if I could talk on the phone. I said yes, and she said they wanted to make an offer. Sounds urgent right?\n\nI told her I was leaning towards accepting, but needed some details cleared up like, how many days was I to be in office/remote? So she said she would get back to me. And she did. And we did a little more back and forth (I asked for a pay increase). Also I reached out to the interviewers to find out if their offer was legit. One of the two replied confirming, and they really wanted me to join their team. Doesn't prove much, but I figured I would try anyway.\n\nSo I get my pay increase, and I accept. The process moves along and the recruiter passes me onto the company's 3rd party onboarding/payroll company. I looked them up, seems legit. The email I received from them was from a woman who had a LinkedIn with a selfie profile picture. I got a link to complete sexual harrassment training, but they said the link expires in 48 hours. Urgency?\n\nBut now it's the onboarding person's most recent email that's worrying me. It said once I fill out the documents in this supposedly secure website, then my drug screening could be scheduled, and \"equipment\" would be shipped to me. On the day it is to be shipped to me, I will receive a call from them confirming my address. When I receive it (24-48 hrs) I need to tell the onboarding person, and finally I will be cleared to come into work on my target date.\n\nThe equipment was vaguely listed as laptop, mouse, stuff like that. Is this a scam? I haven't been asked for any money yet.",

I have seen this before on apparently genuine emails. Is this a red flag or a normal addition? \n\nFYI, I didn't click the link but I think my parents may receive the same email and want to know if I need to warn them.",

I didn't answer the call because I was working but the voice mail said someone opened a Walmart account with my name and number and bought a PS5 and a 3D headset that was damn near $1K USD, and to press 1 to cancel order and another number to speak to someone. Is this a scam or should I be worried?",

We canceled the card, and a new one is on the way. \n\nI will end it with, if you can turn on push notifications, which will tell you about every payment. \n\nIt really saved me a lot of stress because if I hadn't caught it, they might have used it for something else, and I would have needed to proof that those payments weren't mine.",

It was a Telegram message randomly friendly \"job\" offer to review movies for money supposedly for Pixar. Had a website that had a pretty slick interface with lots of Pixar movie graphics and a supportive \"working group\" of about ten people giving advice and lots of encouragement to keep going (you just have to finish this set of movies and it will payout). Started with a small deposit to finish a series of 25 movie reviews, because I had gotten a \"superior film\" which put my account in the negative. In order to complete i had to deposit some of my own money (started out small, like $12) and finished the first series and it paid out like $50, cashed out and should have quit \n\n(plenty of red flags i chose to foolishly ignore, asking for only crypto currency, increasingly higher deposits), but I was getting all this encouragement from the \"working group\" that they were showing big deposits and I just kept dumping money in feeling like the return was just around the corner.\n\nI began trolling the working group and they would get defensive, saying how would Pixar be doing something fake, look at all of us, finishing and getting these big deposits, even threatened me with their \"legal department\" which of course never materialized.\n\nReported it to the BBB, did a Whois and tracked down the AliBaba web host and did a fraud report, trust pilot report and reported to Coinbase. Got the initial website taken down and they just popped up with another domain name in a day. Kept in the working group to keep tabs. Got a couple more domains shut down. \n\nStill pissed they kept popping up, so with the help of ChatGPT I've been learning how to code in Python and wrote script for my own \"scam radar\" that tracked down the source hub for all kinds of scam sites from phishing to these task scams and more, that compiles detailed reports to turn in to the web hosts, servers and IC3.\n\nI have resigned myself to the fact that ill never see my money and that these groups are too big and too sophisticated to get them permanently shut down, but I do get a little solace that I can slow them down and inconvenience them by knocking out the hub for a while, costing the money to restart and keep at least a few people from getting ripped off, and ill keep at it because im pissed and I've got $8k worth of trolling to do to be the karmic justice warrior, lol.\n\nDon't be dumb like I was, they might be pretty savvy, but if they are asking for crypto, on Telegram and WhatsApp and it sounds too good to be true, it definitely is.

The message named a real person and asked me to contact her via a private email on a non-Citi domain.\n\nThat felt off, so I did some investigating instead of replying. What I found:\n\nBurner domain\n\nThe domain used for contact was registered ONE DAY before the outreach. WHOIS showed full privacy masking and shared VPS hosting in the US. The VPS was hosting another 24 unrelated domains.\n\nExecutive impersonation\n\nThe website behind the domain copied the real executive’s name and title, her biography text from Citi’s official press release, and her portrait which I traced via reverse image search to a FinTech news article.\n\nSynthetic website (referenced in the title)\n\nThe site also contained investment fund descriptions copied word-for-word from an unrelated hedge fund’s marketing materials, indicating the site was stitched together from stolen content.\n\nSocial engineering vector\n\nThe LinkedIn message came from a recruiter profile that appears legitimate and long-standing, but whose role and geography had no connection to investment banking. This suggests possible account compromise or misuse rather than a fake profile.\n\nConclusion?\n\nThis appears to be a coordinated executive impersonation scam combining a real, recently promoted executive identity, a just-in-time registered domain, plagiarised investment content, and LinkedIn social engineering to move targets off-platform.\n\nI reported it to Citi via their official phishing channel.\n\nSharing mainly as an example of how scams are evolving. Especially the use of real executives and legitimate-looking LinkedIn accounts.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

After we talked for a bit he asked me if I wanted to do some copy trading on a private broker called “Meta Options” .\n\nI agreed and slowly over the course of a month I put in ~48k. In the end I had ~850k. I was told to initiate a withdrawal with the support team and was told I had to pay a 10% tax upfront before receiving money. I sent it to them and then they said they sent in to my robinhood account but I had never received it.\n\nI was told an error happened because of the size of the withdrawal so they told me to send my base: formerly coinbase wallet eth address.\n\nAfter I sent it I received $850k of a coin called BR2.0 . The problem is that won’t send to robinhood so the support told me to connect with someone who is a special assistant with coinbase. He walked me through the steps and seemed normal but a but sus that it was on whatsapp \n\nI had gotten an error message when I tried swapping that said “something went wrong” when I would click continue and when I told him this he said it was because My account is ineligible to carry out any of these transactions due to my account status. My account holds a significant high balance and it needs to be upgraded before I can be able to carry out my swap or withdrawal.\n\nWhen I asked how to upgrade my coinbase wallet account I was told to pay 15% of my account to a wallet the private broker would provide me and that the coinbase assistant would manually upgrade my account with 2-3 hours and then send the 15% back to me.\n\nAt this point it seemed fishy so I did my own research and saw on google, chatgpt and grok that there is no such thing as an upgraded account on coinbase wallet, let alone it needed a fee.\n\nWhen I brought this up they both said that was general info and my case didn’t pertain to that and was specific so I wouldn’t come on a google search. I also checked the coin and the price was nothing like what i was told, on coinbase wallet it says 20$ but when you check the coin on geckoterminal it says it’s $0.00832.\n\nWhen I brought this all up I was told the coin isn’t worthless it’s just looking that way because my account isn’t upgraded and I don’t have all the features unlocked.\n\nWhen I said I wasn’t paying a dime and said this was scammy I was told that they would suddenly cover some of the costs and when I still said i’m not paying anything and that I was done I was told that he understand my frustration and that another client were paid in similar coin and that there’s been no issue and that the amount I have is high and that’s the main reason and why it’s likely.\n\nThen he said he isn’t here to convince me but and will look for a better option to resolve this and will keep me posted.\n\nDid i get scammed or am I an idiot and should apologize ???",

    "text": "[US] Hospital Bill Scam? TLDR:\n\nGot two calls from a 916 number about a hospital bill I never received. The voicemails were from a bot claiming to be from dignityhealth.org. When I called back, the agent sounded like an outsourced call center, asked for my DOB + address (which I gave), and told me I owe way more than what my insurance should’ve left me to pay. Later I saw that Dignity Health posted an official warning about scammers pretending to collect medical bills. Now I’m worried it might’ve been a scam and whether I’m compromised.\n\nHi everyone I’m trying to understand whether what happened to me is normal or if I just got targeted by a scam.\n\nOver the past couple of days, I received two calls from a 916 area code number. Both times, I missed the call, and each time it went to voicemail. When I checked the messages, it was a bot saying they were from dignityhealth.org and that I had a bill or statement that needed attention.\n\nFor background:\n\nA couple of months ago, I was admitted to a Dignity Health DTLA. But since being discharged, I’ve never received any bill, no statement ID, no itemized bill, nothing. So I was already confused why an automated bot was calling before any physical mail or portal notification.\n\nToday, I finally called the number back. The person who answered sounded like they were from an overseas call center. (Not trying to assume anything)\n\nShe asked for my statement ID, which I didn’t have, and then asked for my dob and address “for security purposes.” I gave those. She then told me the amount I owe, and it was way higher than the estimate I saw when I left the hospital. My oop supposed to be only 10%, but she said the insurance only covered a “small amount,” which doesn’t make sense with my plan.\n\nI asked for an itemized bill, and she said they would mail it to my address.\n\nAfter the call, I did a research and saw  a legit fb post from Dignity Health warning about a recent phone scam where scammers pretend to collect hospital bills. That’s when I started getting anxious because:\n\n\n1.\tThe voicemail came from a bot, not a real billing rep.\n2.\tI still haven’t received any physical bill or online statement.\n3.\tThe amount they quoted doesn’t match the estimated responsibility I saw at discharge.\n4.\tI gave them my DOB and address, which I’m now worried about.\n\nMy questions:\n\n• Could this have been a scam call?\n\n• If it was, how bad is it that they now have my DOB and address?\n\nI tend to get paranoid with stuff like this, but the timing with the scam alert and the weird details have me on edge. Any advice is appreciated.",

They told me that I applied for a loan through them, I don’t recall that I did but since I got the call anyway I thought; might as well see what is this about!\n\nAfter more research, I found out these people are NOT American. The guy who talked to me is from the middle east using a fake name even though that their website states: U.S.-based loan specialist will promptly reach out to help finalize any remaining details and answer your questions.\n\nHe asked me for a soft check of my credit, i was desperate enough to say yes. And when I checked with Transunion, apparently the name of the company was “Cash Keeper”. He told me that I didn’t qualify and directed me to a debt relief service through a company called “Swift Debt Relief”.\n\nTransunion stated the company that pulled my credit was \"Cash Keeper\" and it was through a broker called CIC Credit. I am reaching out to them after this post.\n\nlook at the names:\n\nThe call was from middle eastern “Everest Financial Solution” My credit was pulled through “Cash Keeper” And they tried bait and switch me to sell my information to “Swift Debt Relief”\n\nI told them that I need to run my own research and expecting a call back from them later today, I’ll make sure they’re aware of this post. And these are my findings:\n\nOn their website, the privacy page doesn’t have an update date for the policy, no phone number, they state that they are not direct lenders, yet they promote unsecured loans in their home page?! I mean how bad can it get? This is most likely legal under lending laws. They didn’t run me for a personal loan and refused to give me a Denial Letter per federal law too.\n\nThis is a bait and switch strategy, where they promote something and actually do something else.\n\nThis is also a fake “loan” application process.\n\nLast thing I expected was for a company like “Swift Debt Relief” to be shady enough to hire a bunch of people in the another country without any kind of security measures or protocols to deal with people’s sensitive information.\n\nThey had my first and last name, my address, email, phone number, social number, access to get a copy of my credit, and god knows what else. Aside from the fact that he had the guts to ask for my banking information where I’ll probably end up having all my life savings stolen.\n\nSwift debt relief looks like they have fake reviews on BBB and I emailed BBB regarding their accreditation as I have so many questions now.\n\nDon’t fall for their trap, i’ll make sure this a known knowledge everywhere, and will make sure no one gets scammed the way I almost did.",

    "text": "Hot take of the day: holding them back isn't the answer; slowing down is. I can't speak for everywhere, but the achievement gap at my school is huge. I provide reading intervention in small groups and push in for whole group instruction, so I see a wide range of students at different ability levels.\n\nThe 2nd grade class I push into is on UFLI lesson 86. My intervention group, some of whom are in that same class, is on UFLI lesson 52, and may have to go back and repeat lessons because they still aren't getting it.\n\nAcross all 3 grade levels I pull from, around 50% of the class gets pulled out for reading intervention. They're leagues behind their peers, yet whole group instruction just carries on. They can't understand the new concepts because the new concepts build on old concepts and they haven't mastered those yet either. \n\nClassroom teachers are told they need to conduct a whole group UFLI lesson, then repeat that lesson again in a small group for remediation. But what good does repeating the lesson do when the kids can't access the material? Kids who can't reliably recognize digraphs aren't gonna comprehend multisyllabic words no matter how many times you repeat the same lesson. They lack the foundation. And there's only so much remediation can do to get them on grade level when they're 20+ concepts behind in the pacing guide.\n\nI used to be one of the folks saying we need to stop just passing kids along but when I look at the data, retention doesn't always produce gains. In fact it rarely does. And when it's not just a small handful of kids behind but half the grade level, how on earth can you retain all those students and still have room for new enrollment? It's not possible. \n\nSo I'm in favor of slowing down. Extend the pacing guide. Spend more time on new concepts so kids get more exposure to the material. It made sense to differentiate instruction for the low kids when there were only a handful in each class but if half the class isn't getting it, the curriculum and pacing need to be adjusted to meet that need. Intervention can't fix that. \n\nI know we live in a frantic world that loves to go fast but that's not how our kids are learning. With recreational reading levels dropping and poverty levels rising, school is often the *only* time kids are exposed to these concepts. They're not being reinforced at home anymore. So rather than using intervention as damage control and debating retention at the end of every year, why don't districts adjust to meet students where they *are*? That's how we get them to where we want them to be!",

It’s a bit hard because we rotate classes, so I have about 80 students total.\n\nToday I mentioned to one student that I’ve been in a few Mr. Beast videos (never anything where I’m recognizable in), and they immediately ran to tell other students. I ended up getting bombarded at recess with questions.\n\nI don’t really watch Mr. Beast, especially since I feel like his content is aimed at Gen Alpha, BUT I’m thankful he helped me build some relationships with my students, and I had a few 10 year olds tell me I was the coolest teacher ever.\n\nAs a note, this is a behavior heavy group. So… would it be wrong if I used this as part of my classroom management lol? Saying something like “I’ll call up Mr. Beast if you don’t act right” sort of thing? Obviously can’t do that because I don’t have his number… but they don’t know that.\n\nThank you Mr. Beast for making me the cool teacher 🫡",

    "text": "Hi I’m in need of advice as the parent of a first grade boy. Hi, soo I’ll try to keep this post as short as possible. My family moved to a new district over the summer so this is my son’s first school year here. Everything for the most part has gone smoothly. Everything except for a kid in my son’s class we’ll call him G. So last Friday end of day the students came back from an assembly to get ready for dismissal. For whatever reason g had it in his head to run around and throw all the other kids papers and belongings all over the floor and my son stood up to him, wouldn’t let him touch his things and told him to stop. Well g punches my son in the face. No real injuries but still at this point I’m pissed but I do stand by Boys will be boys. They walk me through what happened on the phone and I ask for a copy of the incident report. Well my son wake up with a fever Saturday so I kept him home until Wednesday. At this point I still hadn’t gotten an email so I called the school and after a brief conversation the report she sent over said verbatim “ on Friday an incident happened and was handled by staff”. And they tried to dead it there. At this point I call back and explained that isn’t good enough I want details on what happened. How it occurred who saw it who intervened and what punishments will be given. At this point she asks me why I even want this. I respond with “ if your son was punched in the face would you be happy with this and she replied no she would not. Also I apologize I should’ve mentioned that my son has come home a handful of times this year saying g has picked on him. Can anyone please tell me if I’m being over board here or not and what steps should I do from here. ( he’s my first and I’ve never been in this situation before. ) thank you for any advice.",

At least the numbers we thought were funny had some form of meaning (69, 21). \n\nThe frightening thing is how meta the meme is. Gotta respect it at the end of the day. Kindergarten is always a couple months behind on whatever meme is going around… and they never quite know when to actually ‘use’ the meme. I guess that must be why 67 works so well. \n\nAnyone else have the 67th day of school today? \n\nHow’d it go? 🤣",

But if you have advice I’d love to hear it.\n\nMy school has a patchwork AC system and since the start of the school year in August, the AC has been out for my specific classroom and one other adjacent room. Everyone else in the building has AC. This fall, all the way into October, my room was regularly 80 degrees by the second half of the day. I was literally dripping in sweat while teaching.\n\nNow in the winter, it still never dips below 75. I have no windows and there’s no air circulation into my room. They gave me a (very loud and distracting) portable AC unit but because it vents back into the classroom, it doesn’t do anything. A box fan makes a very small improvement. I hear no less than a dozen student complaints a day about it and the first thing any adult who walks into my room says is, “wow it’s so hot in here!” (Yes, I know, I’m in here all day…)\n\nAnyway, I found out I’m pregnant about a month ago. I’ll be 8 months pregnant by June and I know the heat will be terrible. Do you have any advice for what I could do to get admin to take this seriously? Is it fair for me to ask a colleague to switch classrooms in the spring since I weathered this most of the year? Very curious to hear your thoughts. If I need to suck it up, I’m open to hearing that too.",

Every male teacher gets to do whatever they want, with no expectations, because we need men to mentor the boys. Coaches are always teacher of the year because they mentor the boys. \n\nI pointed out that we'd had several middle school girls end up pregnant last year, and could we get some real mentorship for them too. Word for word my principal replied \"Well the girls will be alright in the end. They usually are. It's the boys who really need us.\" \n\nI watch teachers fawn over boys doing the bare minimum while girls are doing twice as much on the daily. Boys who are ruining education for everyone are given a single day of ISS under the table, while a girl who does anything out of line gets 3 days of documented suspension. I understand that boys are falling behind in aggregate, but it really feels like a lot of female admin have sons and just assume that girls will figure themselves out while we need to baby the boys.",

On Tuesday my friend and sister opened a door they weren’t supposed to a few minutes before the bell, she was shoving my sister and friend and told my friend that if he didn’t move she would break his fingers. We told a counselor about this,she did nothing. The same para comes to our art room, she’s not supposed to, and only messes with us. The art room is located near a class for special kids. And when I walked down the hallway that day one of them was trying to converse with me. The para yelled at him to not talk to ppl in the hall when all he said was hi and asked if I was happy today. In gym the same para smiled and laughed at us when we were angry that the counselor did nothing. My sister was crying and she was laughing. We went to the principal but it was too late and we were sent back to class, I stood in the hallway and one of my friends asked how she could get away with threatening to break his fingers, she denied it when all of us in my group heard it.",

I am getting extremely frustrated with this as it is unfair to students without IEPs and cannot get extra help on these tests. I don't care if they get a couple of hints for help, but the aide's/teachers are straight up looking up the answers online using ChatGPT and providing that answer and work to those students. ALSO, I know these students do not study, I have asked them before about how much time they spend outside of school studying for tests and they say no because they're too busy with sports or other school after school activities. Some of these students STILL cannot solve simple math problems such as 2x+1=11 and are in Algebra 2 or Geometry. I feel like I am loosing my motivation to continue in education because I came to teach students and sometimes that includes letting them fail so that they learn they need to put some effort into school.\n\nI just needed to rant and see if any of you have any advice on how to deal with this and how to not let it affect you.",

He touches things, he thinks it’s funny when we tell him off and he keeps getting out of his seat. The thing is he’s smart academically. Not only that, he’s an intelligent little boy. He gets on our nerves. I told him one day he won’t be laughing about all this. I know he’s autistic and it’s hard for him to express his wants and needs but he knows what he wants. He was really pushing boundaries so one of the assistant teachers sat him down, got in his face and yelled at him that he needed to stop and it’s not nice. He started to cry. She said, “You need to cry. Show emotions.” I blurred out “Good he needs to cry!” I couldn’t believe that said that. I mean I’m autistic myself so at his age I did speak but I had a difficult time expressing myself. Even though the kid needed a wake up call, I still empathized with him and my heart did hurt a little. Sometimes kids need to learn the hard way. My parents got in my face when I misbehaved and I pushed buttons. I asked her, “Do you think I was mean for what I said.” She said no I wasn’t and she doesn’t think his parents ever gotten into his face. \n\nHe didn’t cry for long and he stopped. \n\nAt home his parents doesn’t give him structure and just lets him do what he wants and not deal with him according to his speech therapist. That’s just sad. I know they love him but make him say hi and give him structure and discipline he needs to succeed. \n\nHe needed tough love but at the same time I sympathize with him. I’m not as “mean” or a yeller like the other two teachers. I found my mama voice. I only raise my voice when they don’t listen. I’m still learning classroom management.",

    "text": "I need to know if anyone else feels this way about “greeting at the door.” For context, I’m a 4th-year teacher (8th grade ELA), and some days it feels like I’ve lived a lifetime already. Shoutout to the teachers who’ve been doing this longer than I have—you’re truly my heroes. As we all know, this generation is incredibly hard to teach for so many reasons. I’m 25, and I constantly find myself trying to understand or relate to my students’ behavior…but I just can’t. I wasn’t a “bad kid,” but even the kids I hung around who were “bad” never acted the way some of my students do now.\n\nTeaching has been a real love/hate relationship. My first year was in a rural public school—rough, like everyone’s first year. The last three years I’ve been at a 3rd–12th grade public charter school. It’s better, but of course every school has its issues.\n\nAnyway, I had a silly but very real thought the other day during one of my overstimulated moments:\nOne of the worst parts of my day is greeting kids at the door.\n\nI know that might sound bad, and yes, there are positives to greeting kids. My first school was big on Capturing Kids’ Hearts, which really pushed the idea that greeting at the door “sets the tone” and “builds relationships”—said mostly by people who, in my opinion, haven’t spent much real time in a classroom.\n\nBut honestly? I feel like standing at my door does more harm than good.\n\nIt’s passing period. Kids are wild. My hallway is shared with 7th–12th graders, and I’m stationed right by two stairwells where everyone funnels through. I see everything: kids jumping on each other, never keeping their hands to themselves, running, yelling, screaming, cussing, spraying water bottles, middle schoolers mixing with high schoolers—my actual nightmare.\n\nAnd because I’m in the hallway, kids who aren’t even my students wander into my room during passing period and start acting up. They know they would never get away with that behavior during class, but they push boundaries when I’m not right there. So I’m constantly switching between correcting hallway chaos and stepping into my room to stop something else. In a 4-minute passing period, this happens multiple times—six times a day.\n\nIt genuinely ruins my day more often than not. I walk into class already irritated or overstimulated, and it feels like the tone is set before class even starts. Other teachers don’t seem bothered, but I can’t shake the feeling that if I don’t address behavior—hallway or classroom—I’m not doing my job. It’s such a conflicting place to be.\n\nI just wish this wasn’t a requirement, and that admin were more present—and when they are present, that they actually step in rather than gentle-parenting every kid through clearly unsafe or inappropriate behavior.\n\nMaybe this is just a rant, but an occasional fist bump, high five, “hello,” or smile does NOT make it worth it for me. I feel like a hall monitor, not a door greeter.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Or am I just a heartless educator?",

There is a weird innocuous and barely perceptible phenomenon I can’t help notice with boys I teach in high school that has only sprung up in the last year or 2.\n\nThere are boys who—in very specific conversational contexts—will lift up (shrug) their shoulders and start rubbing their hands together. The best comparison I can make is like something you’d see from a 1940s cartoon villain plotting something sinister.\n\nSome situations I’ve noticed it: when they’re put on the spot to answer a question; when they want to show they’re “locked in” and thinking about something deeply; almost like a body language way of saying “ok ok let me get ready.” I’ve noticed this more with Latino kids, in case it’s relevant.\n\nAnyway, has anyone else noticed this? I will absolutely delete the hell out of this thread if the first few replies indicate I’m insane lol",

Telling me they all behaved is nonsense and we both know it--not only do I know them, but some of them came to me about problems you just elided in your report to me. Why bother? They're not going to thank you for it, and you're not helping me by lying. ETA: I get not telling me about small stuff.

    "text": "No phone “policy” The school I work with has an awful no phone policy. The governor of our state (as with so many states) made it a thing that students can’t have electronic devices on them at school. They don’t specify the policy but simply that “school districts must establish an anti phone policy” and the school district I work at established the policy of “don’t do it”… that’s it. There is 0 actual policy yet admin gets mad at students for having it out and get mad at teachers for not telling them to put it away.\n\nPart of the governmental requirement for the policy is that there needs to be an established place for the students to store their phones. The school suggested they put it in their lockers…plot twist: NOBODY DOES. They also suggest putting it in their bags which goes against the governors words because it’s not supposed to be with them, their bag counts as with them.\n\nPersonally I think it’s a dumb rule especially for high school. High schoolers should be old enough to be responsible for their own actions, they should know that if you’re on your phone the whole class you likely won’t pass. That’s what it’s like in college and in any job outside of school, nobody will hold your hand and have to force you to put your phone away, you put it away because you know that’s what you need to do or you face the consequences (failing a class or getting fired).\n\nBut it clearly is a huge problem nowadays cuz every kid is addicted to their phone. So if they’re gonna ban phones…they should actually ban phones…\n\nI’ve been substituting for a few months while waiting for my leave replacement to start and  it just started. I’m just paranoid because most teachers and substitutes aren’t constantly telling students to put their phones away, they don’t seem to care that much, and as someone who disagrees with the rule, I don’t care that much either but I’m supposed to. I’m just not sure what I should do bc I know I definitely don’t wanna start taking it from students but at the same time it feels like they use it with me more than they do with their original teacher. It’s really difficult to enforce a rule I don’t agree with. I just wish they’d listen the first time but I have to repeat it over and over. I don’t wanna have to baby sit, it’s my job to teach not to say “put the phone away” 1000 times a day it’s exhausting. Every day I just hope admin doesn’t walk in and sees some students using their phones but when we have any ounce of down time they do that instantly.",

For context, so nobody thinks that I'm stupid, I was homeschooled until high school (I'm in 11th grade now) and I know NOTHING about how this stuff works. \n\nThis week, we were told to have our parents fill out the impact aid forms. They're done online and it's pretty simple. My mom does them immediately. For this class, our teacher said she'd give us extra credit if we filled ours out on time. I did, but my best friend wasn't able to. Despite asking her parents on several occasions, they couldn't be bothered (her dad doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one so he has no excuses). \n\nShe really wanted the extra credit. Despite getting her work done, she has low grades. The extra credit would bump her grade to an A which would be her only A this semester. I wanted that for her. She works hard. I don't think it's fair. \n\nFor my question, can I transfer my extra credit? I don't need it. I don't do my work, but I get good grades. I never study. She does. She deserves it more. It's not fair that she has to miss out on it because her parents didn't want to sign the form. \n\nIf it can't be transferred, could I ask the teacher to give her a few extra credit points on the final project? She completed it on the day it was assigned, even though it's due next week. I don't think anyone else finished. Or could I ask for an extra credit opportunity for her? I don't know. \n\nI love my friends and I don't like when they're sad. It's not even her fault.",

After half my class (and me got it) a general \"what is lice\" letter went to the whole school.\n\nThe issue is the same kids in my class that have it are not being treated properly.

I'm still seeing them crawling in their hair when I walk around during lessons or they are in line. I keep my hair up in a high bun or pulled back in a ponytail and braid.

    "text": "Admin keeps telling me to \"raise the rigor\" but half my class is 3+ grade levels behind \n\nI teach 7th grade ELA in a pretty average public middle school. This year my roster is 31 kids (yes, 31) and I have a big chunk reading at like 3rd to 4th grade. Not \"a little below\", I mean they stumble on basic multisyllabic words, can’t track a paragraph, and if I ask them to write 5 sentences I get 2, maybe 3, with zero punctuation. We’ve had a revolving door of subs in their earlier years and it shows. I’m not blaming the kids, they’re sweet and honestly trying, but the gaps are huge and they’re tired of feeling dumb.\n\n\n\nOur admin is on a district kick right now: RIGOR. Everything is rigor. \"What is the cognitive demand?\" \"Where is the productive struggle?\" \"Why are you scaffolding so much?\" We got handed a walkthrough checklist that might as well say: complex text, grade-level questions, student-led discussion, no sentence starters, minimal teacher talk. Cool. Except when I put an on-grade informational article up, I can watch 12 faces shut down within 90 seconds. So I do what I thought good teaching was. I chunk the text. I pre-teach a few vocab words. I do a quick model. I let them annotate with a guiding question. I keep it moving so they dont spiral. Then admin comes in for a 12 minute walk-through and later emails me: \"Consider reducing supports so students can grapple with the standard.\" Grapple with WHAT. They can’t decode half the page. I had a kid yesterday whisper \"I hate reading because it makes my stomach hurt\" and I swear that broke something in me.\n\n\n\nNow I have a formal observation next week and I’m stressed out of my mind. Admin wants a \"rigorous task\" with evidence-based writing, but if I go full district fantasy mode I’m going to lose them and spend the whole period managing behavior and emotions. If I scaffold like a normal human, I get dinged for \"over-supporting\" and not pushing them. It’s like I’m being asked to build a second floor when we’re still pouring the foundation, and then getting judged because I used a ladder. I’m not anti-rigor. I want them to think, to analyze, to actually grow. But I also want them to experience success sometimes, because right now school is mostly just failure with fluorescent lighting. How are you handling this? Like, what do you actually say in the post-observation meeting when they throw \"raise the bar\" at you? Do you bring data, running records, work samples? Do you just nod and go back to doing what you know works? I’m tired of feeling like I’m doing something wrong by meeting kids where they are.",

Every male teacher gets to do whatever they want, with no expectations, because we need men to mentor the boys. Coaches are always teacher of the year because they mentor the boys. \n\nI pointed out that we'd had several middle school girls end up pregnant last year, and could we get some real mentorship for them too. Word for word my principal replied \"Well the girls will be alright in the end. They usually are. It's the boys who really need us.\" \n\nI watch teachers fawn over boys doing the bare minimum while girls are doing twice as much on the daily. Boys who are ruining education for everyone are given a single day of ISS under the table, while a girl who does anything out of line gets 3 days of documented suspension. I understand that boys are falling behind in aggregate, but it really feels like a lot of female admin have sons and just assume that girls will figure themselves out while we need to baby the boys.",

I teach first grade and I have a student who over the last few weeks has started screaming whenever she doesn't get her way. I'm talking red in the face, sustained horror movie screaming. It's become super triggering for the other kids, I see them flinch and get scared when she starts to scream and cover their ears. \n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\\- calling the office for support: someone might eventually come if they're free but it's not immediate and I need to do something about it while we wait for them \n\n\\- contacting parents: I am in contact with parents and they are no help. They're doing the gentle parenting thing. I actually put Mom on speaker phone while this student was tearing up my classroom and Mom was like \"oh you sound upset right now. Can you tell me why you're upset?\" While the student is literally screaming her lungs out. \n\n\\- doing a room clear: I've tried this a couple times but it just backfires. The student runs out after us and starts hitting kids\n\n\\- ignoring: I've tried coaching the kids to ignore her or just put their hands over their ears but it's pretty hard for a lot of them to do. A lot of her behavior is attention getting so If she notices kids are ignoring her she'll up the ante like throwing things around or climbing up on top of the desks. And of course for 6-year-olds that's just too much to ignore \n\n\\- taking a break/calming corner: The student only starts screaming when she doesn't get her way. When she gets upset like this I've offered her a break, or given her an opportunity to sit in the calming corner with a box of fidgets. But she doesn't want that, she wants me to fold and give her her way. \n\n  \nMy thought was maybe gather the kids on the carpet facing me and the wall so they can't see the rest of the classroom and having them put their hands over their ears. Then we could play a game? Like maybe they have to copy silly faces I make or try to guess what I'm saying by reading my lips. \n\nI don't know I'm just out of ideas at this point. If anyone has any thoughts I would appreciate it!!",

My first year was in a rural public school—rough, like everyone’s first year. The last three years I’ve been at a 3rd–12th grade public charter school. It’s better, but of course every school has its issues.\n\nAnyway, I had a silly but very real thought the other day during one of my overstimulated moments:\nOne of the worst parts of my day is greeting kids at the door.\n\nI know that might sound bad, and yes, there are positives to greeting kids. My first school was big on Capturing Kids’ Hearts, which really pushed the idea that greeting at the door “sets the tone” and “builds relationships”—said mostly by people who, in my opinion, haven’t spent much real time in a classroom.\n\nBut honestly? I feel like standing at my door does more harm than good.\n\nIt’s passing period. Kids are wild. My hallway is shared with 7th–12th graders, and I’m stationed right by two stairwells where everyone funnels through. I see everything: kids jumping on each other, never keeping their hands to themselves, running, yelling, screaming, cussing, spraying water bottles, middle schoolers mixing with high schoolers—my actual nightmare.\n\nAnd because I’m in the hallway, kids who aren’t even my students wander into my room during passing period and start acting up. They know they would never get away with that behavior during class, but they push boundaries when I’m not right there. So I’m constantly switching between correcting hallway chaos and stepping into my room to stop something else. In a 4-minute passing period, this happens multiple times—six times a day.\n\nIt genuinely ruins my day more often than not. I walk into class already irritated or overstimulated, and it feels like the tone is set before class even starts. Other teachers don’t seem bothered, but I can’t shake the feeling that if I don’t address behavior—hallway or classroom—I’m not doing my job. It’s such a conflicting place to be.\n\nI just wish this wasn’t a requirement, and that admin were more present—and when they are present, that they actually step in rather than gentle-parenting every kid through clearly unsafe or inappropriate behavior.\n\nMaybe this is just a rant, but an occasional fist bump, high five, “hello,” or smile does NOT make it worth it for me. I feel like a hall monitor, not a door greeter.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Or am I just a heartless educator?",

    "text": "Admin keeps telling me to \"raise the rigor\" but half my class is 3+ grade levels behind \n\nI teach 7th grade ELA in a pretty average public middle school. This year my roster is 31 kids (yes, 31) and I have a big chunk reading at like 3rd to 4th grade. Not \"a little below\", I mean they stumble on basic multisyllabic words, can’t track a paragraph, and if I ask them to write 5 sentences I get 2, maybe 3, with zero punctuation. We’ve had a revolving door of subs in their earlier years and it shows. I’m not blaming the kids, they’re sweet and honestly trying, but the gaps are huge and they’re tired of feeling dumb.\n\n\n\nOur admin is on a district kick right now: RIGOR. Everything is rigor. \"What is the cognitive demand?\" \"Where is the productive struggle?\" \"Why are you scaffolding so much?\" We got handed a walkthrough checklist that might as well say: complex text, grade-level questions, student-led discussion, no sentence starters, minimal teacher talk. Cool. Except when I put an on-grade informational article up, I can watch 12 faces shut down within 90 seconds. So I do what I thought good teaching was. I chunk the text. I pre-teach a few vocab words. I do a quick model. I let them annotate with a guiding question. I keep it moving so they dont spiral. Then admin comes in for a 12 minute walk-through and later emails me: \"Consider reducing supports so students can grapple with the standard.\" Grapple with WHAT. They can’t decode half the page. I had a kid yesterday whisper \"I hate reading because it makes my stomach hurt\" and I swear that broke something in me.\n\n\n\nNow I have a formal observation next week and I’m stressed out of my mind. Admin wants a \"rigorous task\" with evidence-based writing, but if I go full district fantasy mode I’m going to lose them and spend the whole period managing behavior and emotions. If I scaffold like a normal human, I get dinged for \"over-supporting\" and not pushing them. It’s like I’m being asked to build a second floor when we’re still pouring the foundation, and then getting judged because I used a ladder. I’m not anti-rigor. I want them to think, to analyze, to actually grow. But I also want them to experience success sometimes, because right now school is mostly just failure with fluorescent lighting. How are you handling this? Like, what do you actually say in the post-observation meeting when they throw \"raise the bar\" at you? Do you bring data, running records, work samples? Do you just nod and go back to doing what you know works? I’m tired of feeling like I’m doing something wrong by meeting kids where they are.",

Standardized tests This rant is about rating teachers, especially high school teachers, on standardized tests like STAR, PSAT, etc...... \n\nIf our leaders are going to require students to take standardized tests in high school, then there needs to be more serious incentives. The common.....  \"Hoping they will do well\"  \"Everyone will graduate who stays here because our enrollment has to look good\"  \"No failures to students for class grades even if they perform low\"  \"Not knowing the results until the third week of July for PSAT\"  \"Giving these tests during the times of the year that students are already bogged down with stress from other classes or the time of the year they have checked out\"  \"Putting the problem on teachers\"  Are all very frustrating.  I mean there needs to be things required then if students don't do well.  An extra class to help prepare, not getting to participate in clubs/sports, maybe not even graduate if they are too low. \n\nWhen I wanted to become a high school math teacher, I had to take the praxis for math.  I didn't pass it the first time.  I couldn't go back and complain to my calculus III teacher at the university I had, and complain that a triple integral was on there that professor a didn't go over.  I couldn't say that taking that my higher level differential equations professor didn't discuss more concepts to help me prepare for this test.  I couldn't complain to that my university didn't go over more geometry topics.   Guess what, I had to actually do it and review some things I learned and actually learn a few things new on my own and I did fine.  BUT I HAD to want it because the RESULT was that I was going to be able to teach high school math if I passed it. \n\nIf students know they will still graduate or won't get penalized for low standardized test scores what is the use?\n\nIn many ways, this is why I think standardized tests should be removed, unless there are serious incentives involved for students.",

    "text": "The teacher in my life is struggling, how can I help him? Hi everyone, \n\nI'm reaching out because I've exhausted all other avenues to try and help my boyfriend. Sorry this is a long post.\n\nWe've been together since 2018, and this year will be his 10th year teaching. When we first met, he loved his job, he loved being a teacher but since covid, he's changed a lot regarding his job, and this year is the most intense so far. My understanding is, he is worried about the kids. They are almost all struggling, there's a huge gap between what they should know and what they actually know. He's been struggling with behavioural problems as well. The kids can't stay put for more than 15 minutes, he spends more time policing the cellphones than actually teaching. **He fears that all he's doing is setting them up for failure.**\n\nHe teaches the us-equivalent to high school maths, and since last year he's been coming home completely lifeless and he's been crying a lot.\n\nI feel like I've tried everything to cheer him up or to help him find a solution, but nothing has worked and I feel like I've just made it worse. So far, I've tried :\n\n\\- Making long term plans (like vacations, working together on projects) to help him get his mind on something else once he leaves the classroom.\n\n\\- Listening and letting him empty his bag as often and as much as he wants.\n\n\\- I've offered to help him find a therapist or someone who specialized in mental health to help him work through it.\n\nThe result of all these :\n\n\\- we went on a Canada-US wide road trip last summer for 7 weeks, and I hadn't seen him so happy and free in a very long time, but as soon as the school year started, it only took 4 weeks to undo everything.\n\n\\- Listening to him and letting him empty his bag I feel like made it worse, after he feels terrible to force me to listen to him \"whining\" (that's what he calls it) and he doesn't feel better after that.\n\n\\- The therapist approach was more complicated, I brought it up in a \"I want to listen to your problems, but I think a specialist may be able to help you go through your feelings better\". He went twice but didn't enjoy it.\n\nTuesday, I told him that if he wanted to, he could quit, and that there was no shame in it. I make enough money to pay for the rent and the both of us, and there is no point working this hard if he is this unhappy. I understand now that it wasn't a smart move and all I did was made him upset. He told me that he needed to do it because if he quits, that means the kids will be worse off and that it wasn't about the money, it was about the mission.\n\n \n\nNow I'm at a loss. I don't know what else to do. I love him, I want to see him happy, but I feel powerless. Right now, it feels like my only next move is to run and be elected prime minister so I can fix the school system but, admittedly, it's a long shot. \n\nIs there anything else I can do to help him? What worked for some of you who experienced the same thing? Do teacher support groups exist? Should I start printing pamphlets and what do you think my slogan should be?\n\nNote: money is not an issue, if I have to work more to make sure he's happy, I will.",

It’s upper elementary, so they’re old enough to know better than the things they do.

We rotate classes and I only teach one subject, and with one of my classes, so far we’re lucky if we get 3/4 of the way through (if that). \n\nI also have a 45 minute commute, so by the time I get home I just want to crash. Does anyone have any advice on how to make this better? I feel like there’s not anything I can cut out of my after school schedule to leave any earlier.",

Hi all! \n\nHigh-school geography teacher from Sydney, Australia here! \n\nI’m really curious to hear about any experiences, opinions, thoughts, studies/data about technology-free/technology-light schools (for students, during school hours). It doesn’t have to be strictly no-technology either, especially for using it where it’s directly relevant to the subject/discipline like computing, engineering, photography, etc.\n\nWithout trying to be crass, I’m not looking for responses about schools that can’t afford the “standard” technology, or purposely alternative schools, such as Steiner schools, rather mostly mainstream schools who can afford to implement, but don’t or have walked it back.\n\nFor context, I’d define “standard technology” to be a combination of the following: a device for each student, a student LMS like Canvas/Compass, access to a suite of apps like Microsoft/Google Apps. At least that is the standard here in Australia, not sure about elsewhere like the US. From what I can gather most teachers on here seem to be from the US or elsewhere so I’d love to hear from you all.",

There’s nothing particularly bad about her, but nothing great either. \n\nHer classroom management abilities have been subpar, she’s violated FERPA a few times by mentioning sensitive information about certain students to other parents in her PTC meetings and she’s always complaining about her work duties, despite having one of the better schedules and a comparatively smaller number of duties. She’s dating a male teacher on campus (her business, I guess?) She talks about doing the bare minimum to get by and makes openly-snarky remarks about how she doesn’t really care about the students. At our recent Back To School Night in October, for example, some teachers noticed that almost none of her kids showed up and when they remarked about it, she straight up said “I don’t really care if they come or not!”\n\nWell, I just found out today that she’s getting promoted by our admin to a special position to help students access college courses and will have minimal classroom duties. \n\nI really don’t get it, y’all? \n\nI’m so tired at this point. \n\nBeen in the classroom the better part of a decade now and I still just can’t with some of the shit I’ve seen. \n\nIt’s so demoralizing.",

I’m looking for some perspective from teachers who’ve worked across different grade levels.\n\nI currently teach kindergarten online (yes, it’s wild), about four hours a day, four days a week. Our schedule would stay the same regardless of the grade level I teach. I’ve taught 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th in the past, but kindergarten feels uniquely exhausting — lots of performing, lots of managing attention spans, and lots of listening to very passionate tangents about unicorns. This year especially, I’m finding it harder to sustain that energy.\n\nMy mom is a middle school math teacher (6th–8th), and I’ve completed some math coursework myself. I’d just need to pass the subject tests to make the switch, which feels doable.\n\nMy question:\nHas anyone here taught lower elementary as a multiple subject teacher and middle school as a single subject (specifically math)? Which did you prefer, and why? Was the transition worth it? Did the workload or emotional load feel different?\n\nI’m trying to make an informed decision before changing directions. I already have everything planned out for kindergarten, but part of me is craving something that feels a bit more intellectually challenging — and maybe even more rewarding.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences!",

For context, so nobody thinks that I'm stupid, I was homeschooled until high school (I'm in 11th grade now) and I know NOTHING about how this stuff works. \n\nThis week, we were told to have our parents fill out the impact aid forms. They're done online and it's pretty simple. My mom does them immediately. For this class, our teacher said she'd give us extra credit if we filled ours out on time. I did, but my best friend wasn't able to. Despite asking her parents on several occasions, they couldn't be bothered (her dad doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one so he has no excuses). \n\nShe really wanted the extra credit. Despite getting her work done, she has low grades. The extra credit would bump her grade to an A which would be her only A this semester. I wanted that for her. She works hard. I don't think it's fair. \n\nFor my question, can I transfer my extra credit? I don't need it. I don't do my work, but I get good grades. I never study. She does. She deserves it more. It's not fair that she has to miss out on it because her parents didn't want to sign the form. \n\nIf it can't be transferred, could I ask the teacher to give her a few extra credit points on the final project? She completed it on the day it was assigned, even though it's due next week. I don't think anyone else finished. Or could I ask for an extra credit opportunity for her? I don't know. \n\nI love my friends and I don't like when they're sad. It's not even her fault.",

    "text": "Parents don’t realize how much they quietly undo everything we do in the classroom I’ve been teaching for a while now and I’m used to the usual challenges, behavior issues, admin nonsense, lack of resources, all of that comes with the job. What still catches me off guard though is how often the real work I’m doing gets undone at home, not maliciously, not on purpose, just casually. I’ll spend weeks setting clear expectations with a student, working on accountability, follow through, basic responsibility. We talk about consequences, about how actions lead to outcomes, and I’ll see real progress. Then one conversation with a parent happens and suddenly we’re back to square one. I’ll get an email saying their child was “confused” or “felt targeted” when they recieved a consequence that had been clearly explained beforehand. Or the parent will insist their kid was just tired, stressed, hungry, misunderstood, anything except responsible. It’s not even the big blowups that hurt the most, it’s the small steady pattern of parents stepping in to soften every edge of reality. When students know that mom or dad will swoop in and smooth things over, it changes how seriously they take anything we say in class. \n\nThe moment it really hit me was earlier this year with a student who constantly refused to do work. Not disruptive, not loud, just a flat refusal and a shrug. I worked with them, adjusted assignments, checked in privately, documented everything. Eventually I followed our school policy and contacted home. The parent responded with a long message about how school has always been hard for their child, how pressure shuts them down, how consequences make things worse. I empathize with that, truely, but then came the line that stuck with me. They said they told their child that they didn’t actually have to do the assignment if it felt overwhelming and that they supported that decision. The next day the student walked in with a smile I’d never seen before and said “my parent said it’s fine if I don’t do this”. And just like that all structure was gone. I wasn’t angry, I was deflated. Because now I’m not teaching one kid, I’m teaching against an invisible voice at home that’s telling them effort is optional when it’s uncomfortable. Parents often say they want teachers to prepare kids for the real world, but then they shield them from every uncomfortable moment along the way. I know most parents mean well and are trying to protect their kids, but protection without boundaries turns into sabotage. It makes our jobs harder and honestly it doesn’t help the kids either. Sometimes I wish parents could see that we’re not the enemy, we’re not out to get their child, we’re trying to help them grow, and growth is messy and frustrating and sometimes hard. When that gets erased at home, it feels like trying to build something on sand, no matter how carefully you work.",

    "text": "Accommodation Trackers are absolutely ridiculous I am a teacher in a large high school in a large state. I have well over 30 sped students with IEPs and various accommodations. We have now been told we have to do “accommodation trackers.”\n\nThese are huge spreadsheets for each student that list EVERY SINGLE ACCOMMODATION for each student. We then have to go in every day and click if we provided or did not provide each student’s various accommodation that day. This can easily turn into going through over 20 accommodations for each student. I have over 30 sped students, some of us have over 50. So every day I am supposed to go into over 30 different spreadsheets and fill out each one for each kid all while teaching? Please. What a fucking joke.\n\nThe SPED program, while important, is out of hand. This isn’t realistic. I’m tired of admin cowering to parents over fear of a lawsuit, throwing us to the wolves to figure it out. Does anyone else have to do these trackers?",

    "text": "\"boymom\" attitude among educators I'm noticing a big push recently in my district to save the boys. There are four different mentorship programs for the boys. Every male teacher gets to do whatever they want, with no expectations, because we need men to mentor the boys. Coaches are always teacher of the year because they mentor the boys. \n\nI pointed out that we'd had several middle school girls end up pregnant last year, and could we get some real mentorship for them too. Word for word my principal replied \"Well the girls will be alright in the end. They usually are. It's the boys who really need us.\" \n\nI watch teachers fawn over boys doing the bare minimum while girls are doing twice as much on the daily. Boys who are ruining education for everyone are given a single day of ISS under the table, while a girl who does anything out of line gets 3 days of documented suspension. I understand that boys are falling behind in aggregate, but it really feels like a lot of female admin have sons and just assume that girls will figure themselves out while we need to baby the boys.",

    "text": "Worst decision from school as of yet Flagged as humor because I cant stop laughing.\n\nSo my school started an active collaboration with a few other schools. The decision was made to have students from other schools tutor kids from ours and vice versa. This went well for a big part of our semester. \n\nThe dumb part is that admin at our school had this bright idea to have those pubescent tutors help other pubescent students without supervision so that we as teachers could teach another class at that time. \n\nA veteran colleague of mine (lets call her Anne) advocated how dumb of an idea this would be but admin didnt want to hear any of it. \n\nThe aftermath is amazing. We have parents from female students call about some of the behaviour of those male tutors and we, allegedly, had a few male students ask for the number of a female tutor. \n\nWhen the admin asked Anne to help deal with it, she apparently responded by saying she helped out by telling its a bad idea and she wont help out further than that.\n\nIm typing this out in the teachers room after hearing this full story from multiple teachers including Anne and im looking at Anne who is just sipping her coffee and scrolling on her phone and think she is absolutely amazing.\n\nSome more info: the tutors are 16-18year old. and the students are 14-16 year old.",

    "text": "Hot take of the day: holding them back isn't the answer; slowing down is. I can't speak for everywhere, but the achievement gap at my school is huge. I provide reading intervention in small groups and push in for whole group instruction, so I see a wide range of students at different ability levels.\n\nThe 2nd grade class I push into is on UFLI lesson 86. My intervention group, some of whom are in that same class, is on UFLI lesson 52, and may have to go back and repeat lessons because they still aren't getting it.\n\nAcross all 3 grade levels I pull from, around 50% of the class gets pulled out for reading intervention. They're leagues behind their peers, yet whole group instruction just carries on. They can't understand the new concepts because the new concepts build on old concepts and they haven't mastered those yet either. \n\nClassroom teachers are told they need to conduct a whole group UFLI lesson, then repeat that lesson again in a small group for remediation. But what good does repeating the lesson do when the kids can't access the material? Kids who can't reliably recognize digraphs aren't gonna comprehend multisyllabic words no matter how many times you repeat the same lesson. They lack the foundation. And there's only so much remediation can do to get them on grade level when they're 20+ concepts behind in the pacing guide.\n\nI used to be one of the folks saying we need to stop just passing kids along but when I look at the data, retention doesn't always produce gains. In fact it rarely does. And when it's not just a small handful of kids behind but half the grade level, how on earth can you retain all those students and still have room for new enrollment? It's not possible. \n\nSo I'm in favor of slowing down. Extend the pacing guide. Spend more time on new concepts so kids get more exposure to the material. It made sense to differentiate instruction for the low kids when there were only a handful in each class but if half the class isn't getting it, the curriculum and pacing need to be adjusted to meet that need. Intervention can't fix that. \n\nI know we live in a frantic world that loves to go fast but that's not how our kids are learning. With recreational reading levels dropping and poverty levels rising, school is often the *only* time kids are exposed to these concepts. They're not being reinforced at home anymore. So rather than using intervention as damage control and debating retention at the end of every year, why don't districts adjust to meet students where they *are*? That's how we get them to where we want them to be!",

We’re enabling them.\n\nLife does not care about their personal problems the way schools do. If they walk into a job and behave the way they do in some of our classrooms? They’re fired. Immediately.

Better they learn that now, with small, developmentally appropriate consequences, than get smacked with it at 18 when a boss doesn’t play.\n\nAccountability is not cruelty. Structure is not punishment. Consequences are not trauma. This is about preparing kids for the real world, not cushioning them from every discomfort.\n\nStop worrying so much about optics and pass rates.

The boys are getting it now and coming in with shaved heads.\n\nI was also told, because of HIPPA that we cannot announce anything like- your child has been exposed to headlice. After half my class (and me got it) a general \"what is lice\" letter went to the whole school.\n\nThe issue is the same kids in my class that have it are not being treated properly. Their hair is constantly down. One parent said she did a treatment almost a month ago and thought it was fine. I explained its every 7-10 days after the 1st treatment.\n\nI don't understand why this is not taken seriously anymore? I'm still seeing them crawling in their hair when I walk around during lessons or they are in line. I keep my hair up in a high bun or pulled back in a ponytail and braid.

I teach first grade and I have a student who over the last few weeks has started screaming whenever she doesn't get her way. I'm talking red in the face, sustained horror movie screaming. It's become super triggering for the other kids, I see them flinch and get scared when she starts to scream and cover their ears. \n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\\- calling the office for support: someone might eventually come if they're free but it's not immediate and I need to do something about it while we wait for them \n\n\\- contacting parents: I am in contact with parents and they are no help. They're doing the gentle parenting thing. I actually put Mom on speaker phone while this student was tearing up my classroom and Mom was like \"oh you sound upset right now. Can you tell me why you're upset?\" While the student is literally screaming her lungs out. \n\n\\- doing a room clear: I've tried this a couple times but it just backfires. The student runs out after us and starts hitting kids\n\n\\- ignoring: I've tried coaching the kids to ignore her or just put their hands over their ears but it's pretty hard for a lot of them to do. A lot of her behavior is attention getting so If she notices kids are ignoring her she'll up the ante like throwing things around or climbing up on top of the desks. And of course for 6-year-olds that's just too much to ignore \n\n\\- taking a break/calming corner: The student only starts screaming when she doesn't get her way. When she gets upset like this I've offered her a break, or given her an opportunity to sit in the calming corner with a box of fidgets. But she doesn't want that, she wants me to fold and give her her way. \n\n  \nMy thought was maybe gather the kids on the carpet facing me and the wall so they can't see the rest of the classroom and having them put their hands over their ears. Then we could play a game? Like maybe they have to copy silly faces I make or try to guess what I'm saying by reading my lips. \n\nI don't know I'm just out of ideas at this point. If anyone has any thoughts I would appreciate it!!",

Some of them have gotten pretty close (not that I’ll ever tell them that) but one group guessed 45 and I said yes with a straight face, and I guess they believed me because they went and told all their friends I’m 45 years old.\n\nI’ve also convinced various kids that I don’t have any social media and have never heard of Instagram, that I don’t know what a movie is, that I have zero dollars in my bank account, that I used to live in Antarctica, and that I don’t know how to count past 50 (I am a math teacher so I really don’t know how they bought that one). I guess I just have a good poker face.\n\nOf course I don’t lie to them about important things but I think it’s fun to keep them on their toes and not let them think they know anything about my life. What’s the funniest or strangest thing you’ve gotten a student to believe?\n\nEdit: Ok you guys are ALL funnier than me.",

    "text": "Sent in to Panic Mode… My school uses a program that allows parents to message us. Our admin is pretty laid back, but they do expect us to respond in a timely manner (within 24 hours) and during contract hours. They have pretty much told us outside of contract hours we do not need to answer. I have a class this year that I would say is the hardest class I have ever had. This is my eighth year teaching. I have a class that is double the size of any class I have had before… So I have 30 first graders running around. I have a lot of students who can do the work, but some who are struggling. I feel like I am bending over backwards for some of these kids and their parents trying to help them as much as I can. \n\nI have one parent who sends me into full on panic mode any time I interact with her at this point. During P/T conferences in November, I scheduled a conference with them. They never showed up. I called and rescheduled it because I really wanted to meet with them. They didn’t show up a second time. I am trying so hard with their student. They called my boss to complain about me because I am “picking on” their child by following my behavior management plan with them. I have made accommodations and even created a whole new behavior management system for their child. It still isn’t enough. The mom was slamming me on social media the other day… Talking about how I’m the worst teacher she’s ever seen, I do nothing for her student and how she’s going to tell them to behave crazy at school just to ruin my life. All because I called her to tell her that her child did not qualify for our monthly behavior reward party. I showed the post to admin and they called her and took care of it. I am not friends with her on Facebook. I was sent the post by a friend who is friends with her on Facebook. \n\nI am off work for a funeral this afternoon. The mom sent me a message and it popped up on my phone. It sent me into full blown panic mode. Just seeing her name pop up made my heart start pounding and made me feel like I could throw up. I cannot comprehend how some people think it is okay to act this way towards their child’s teachers. I understand that some people are hard to please, but it really has worn me down.",

    "text": "Admin keeps telling me to \"raise the rigor\" but half my class is 3+ grade levels behind \n\nI teach 7th grade ELA in a pretty average public middle school. This year my roster is 31 kids (yes, 31) and I have a big chunk reading at like 3rd to 4th grade. Not \"a little below\", I mean they stumble on basic multisyllabic words, can’t track a paragraph, and if I ask them to write 5 sentences I get 2, maybe 3, with zero punctuation. We’ve had a revolving door of subs in their earlier years and it shows. I’m not blaming the kids, they’re sweet and honestly trying, but the gaps are huge and they’re tired of feeling dumb.\n\n\n\nOur admin is on a district kick right now: RIGOR. Everything is rigor. \"What is the cognitive demand?\" \"Where is the productive struggle?\" \"Why are you scaffolding so much?\" We got handed a walkthrough checklist that might as well say: complex text, grade-level questions, student-led discussion, no sentence starters, minimal teacher talk. Cool. Except when I put an on-grade informational article up, I can watch 12 faces shut down within 90 seconds. So I do what I thought good teaching was. I chunk the text. I pre-teach a few vocab words. I do a quick model. I let them annotate with a guiding question. I keep it moving so they dont spiral. Then admin comes in for a 12 minute walk-through and later emails me: \"Consider reducing supports so students can grapple with the standard.\" Grapple with WHAT. They can’t decode half the page. I had a kid yesterday whisper \"I hate reading because it makes my stomach hurt\" and I swear that broke something in me.\n\n\n\nNow I have a formal observation next week and I’m stressed out of my mind. Admin wants a \"rigorous task\" with evidence-based writing, but if I go full district fantasy mode I’m going to lose them and spend the whole period managing behavior and emotions. If I scaffold like a normal human, I get dinged for \"over-supporting\" and not pushing them. It’s like I’m being asked to build a second floor when we’re still pouring the foundation, and then getting judged because I used a ladder. I’m not anti-rigor. I want them to think, to analyze, to actually grow. But I also want them to experience success sometimes, because right now school is mostly just failure with fluorescent lighting. How are you handling this? Like, what do you actually say in the post-observation meeting when they throw \"raise the bar\" at you? Do you bring data, running records, work samples? Do you just nod and go back to doing what you know works? I’m tired of feeling like I’m doing something wrong by meeting kids where they are.",

    "text": "I'm a good teacher, just not sure if I'm good at my job? This is a confession that I hate to admit. I am really bad at using data to inform my teaching. In fact, almost all of my teaching is based on informal assessment.\n\n  \nSo many of my colleagues are very good at using test scores and assessments to evaluate their kids and figure out exactly what and who they should prioritize. I don't. I do what's required of me in terms of testing, but I can tell a lot more about what a kid knows and doesn't know by what I actually see them doing than what some numbers on a screen tell me.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, I just feel like I'm really coming up short in this area. Especially when it comes to things like my resume, where I don't have as much hard data to put like \"improved x test scores by x percent\" because I just don't focus on that stuff like I should.\n\n  \nI know I should care more. But two of my students with the lowest test scores have some of the most involved parents. They're actually staff members at the school who I know well. Whereas some of my higher scoring kids are kids with bad home lives and worse behavior. And I find it so hard to not focus more on the social emotional needs of the students in my classroom, knowing that the kids who are lower on paper have and will have more support.\n\n  \nI had a student who scored well on a standardized test but threw angry fits every day in class at the start of the year because he was incapable of regulating his emotions. He is now a leader in the class and gets to play assistant teacher and help other students. He hasn't had an outburst in weeks. That doesn't show up on the tests. Two of my little girls talked to other students about respect during recess. That doesn't show up on the tests. One of the lower scoring kids now reads for fun. That doesn't show up on the tests.\n\n  \nI know I'm a good teacher. The kids and my admin have convinced me of that. But THE TESTS. IM NOT GOOD AT THE TESTS. How bad is this?",

    "text": "Potty Issues vs. Treasure Box First time poster on this sub. I’m at a crossroads here!\n\nI have a student who is struggling with managing the bathroom. Since the school year started, this issue has only escalated to the point where in this week alone we are changing clothes 3 times a day due to them soiling their clothes with a #2.\n\nWe just started a procedure chart. We have a smiley system chart. Parents are aware and have seen doctors to fix the issue. I am leaning towards this being a behavior issue as, despite lots of support, reassurance, and positive reinforcement, it is still happening.\n\nI am very torn between wanting to reward their good behaviors with treasure box versus revoke the treasure box from this student until we see some change. It feels harsh though, but I am struggling to see other alternatives.\n\nIf anyone has had similar experiences or has any good advice on how to manage a problem like this, that would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I’m looking at it all wrong. SOS please help!!!\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented with their perspectives and insight. Rest assured my friend did indeed get their treasure box today, they do a great job of earning it weekly and in hindsight I might’ve not been my best self today in considering taking it away. They clearly don’t deserve that as a consequence for something they can’t help, thank you fellow teachers/parents/supports/Redditors for shaking some sense into a crashing out tired teacher on a Friday after a long busy week. I have a lot to sort out suggestions wise to present on Monday and we do have Winter break coming up in a week, so my hope is there will definitely be some improvement by next year. Til then, we will hang tight, keep supporting and uplifting, and working with the student and their family as we move forward. Have a great weekend, people!",

    "text": "Admin told me to \"fix\" my grades so the data looks better. I refused and now I am the difficult one. High school ELA, 10th grade, US public. Our district switched to a new online gradebook this year that color codes everything, so admin can instantly see who has a bunch of Ds and Fs. My classes are rough academically. I have a lot of kids reading at a middle school level, chronic absenteeism, several who just flat out put their heads down most of the period. I still give chances to redo, I chunk assignments, I call home, I try to differentiate without losing my mind. Even with all that, about a third of my kids are currently failing because they just dont turn work in or only show up physically, not mentally. I document like crazy, because I know how this goes. Last week AP calls me into his office with a printed spreadsheet of my grade distribution. He starts with the fake nice voice: \"Help me understand why so many of your students are not successful.\" I walked him through specific kids, missing work, behavior notes, parent calls. He nodded and then said, word for word, \"Okay, but the problem is that these numbers make us look bad as a school. Parents and the district see failure rates, not context. We need to get more of these kids to at least a C.\" I said I am happy to keep offering retakes and make up work, but I am not inventing grades that arent earned. He replied, \"Im not saying to make up grades, Im saying to be flexible. Reweigh some assignments, give more heavy credit for participation, look at who 'really needs' the boost.\" Basically, fudge it so the red boxes turn green.\n\n\n\nThe part that really sent me over the edge: yesterday I got 3 parent emails in a row clearly prompted by him. All some variation of \"AP So-and-so showed us your gradebook and was concerned about how many low grades there are. He said we should reach out to you to discuss what you can do to support our child in raising their grade.\" Not one mention of what the student could do. Just what I should change. I already have a very clear late work policy, extra help days posted, and weekly emails that go out with missing work lists. When I responded with specific steps the kids could take, one parent fired back, \"I dont think it is fair that my daughter has a 52 when she is in class every day. Can you curve the tests or add extra credit so she passes? The AP said teachers have discretion.\" I brought all of this to the AP and he basically shrugged and said \"Families expect kids to pass if they show up. We have to meet them halfway, or they go to the board and ask why the teacher fails so many students.\" I told him point blank that passing a kid who cannot write a basic paragraph is not \"meeting halfway\", it is lying on paper, and that I am not comfortable with that ethically. He sighed and said, \"Well, you do you, but be prepared for some tough conversations during evaluations if your data doesnt improve.\" So now I am stuck feeling like if I hold my line, my eval is in danger, and if I give in, I am just part of the giant game of pretending everything is fine while kids cant read. I know none of this is new, but it is hitting harder this year for some reason. I am tired of being the last stop between reality and the spreadsheet. Is anyone else getting this direct pressure to \"fix\" the numbers instead of the instruction, and how are you handling it without either selling out your standards or getting labeled as the problem teacher?",

    "text": "I need to know if anyone else feels this way about “greeting at the door.” For context, I’m a 4th-year teacher (8th grade ELA), and some days it feels like I’ve lived a lifetime already. Shoutout to the teachers who’ve been doing this longer than I have—you’re truly my heroes. As we all know, this generation is incredibly hard to teach for so many reasons. I’m 25, and I constantly find myself trying to understand or relate to my students’ behavior…but I just can’t. I wasn’t a “bad kid,” but even the kids I hung around who were “bad” never acted the way some of my students do now.\n\nTeaching has been a real love/hate relationship. My first year was in a rural public school—rough, like everyone’s first year. The last three years I’ve been at a 3rd–12th grade public charter school. It’s better, but of course every school has its issues.\n\nAnyway, I had a silly but very real thought the other day during one of my overstimulated moments:\nOne of the worst parts of my day is greeting kids at the door.\n\nI know that might sound bad, and yes, there are positives to greeting kids. My first school was big on Capturing Kids’ Hearts, which really pushed the idea that greeting at the door “sets the tone” and “builds relationships”—said mostly by people who, in my opinion, haven’t spent much real time in a classroom.\n\nBut honestly? I feel like standing at my door does more harm than good.\n\nIt’s passing period. Kids are wild. My hallway is shared with 7th–12th graders, and I’m stationed right by two stairwells where everyone funnels through. I see everything: kids jumping on each other, never keeping their hands to themselves, running, yelling, screaming, cussing, spraying water bottles, middle schoolers mixing with high schoolers—my actual nightmare.\n\nAnd because I’m in the hallway, kids who aren’t even my students wander into my room during passing period and start acting up. They know they would never get away with that behavior during class, but they push boundaries when I’m not right there. So I’m constantly switching between correcting hallway chaos and stepping into my room to stop something else. In a 4-minute passing period, this happens multiple times—six times a day.\n\nIt genuinely ruins my day more often than not. I walk into class already irritated or overstimulated, and it feels like the tone is set before class even starts. Other teachers don’t seem bothered, but I can’t shake the feeling that if I don’t address behavior—hallway or classroom—I’m not doing my job. It’s such a conflicting place to be.\n\nI just wish this wasn’t a requirement, and that admin were more present—and when they are present, that they actually step in rather than gentle-parenting every kid through clearly unsafe or inappropriate behavior.\n\nMaybe this is just a rant, but an occasional fist bump, high five, “hello,” or smile does NOT make it worth it for me. I feel like a hall monitor, not a door greeter.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Or am I just a heartless educator?",

    "text": "Sub. Teacher/English student. Idk what to do anymore. I (24f) need advice, idk if I just had a bad day and it pushed me to my breaking point or if I just need to vent. I’m a Secondary English ed. Student at my local college, my friends told me I should try substitute teaching as extra experience since I had been teetering on whether or not I wanted to do this. I started in February of this year and honestly loved it. I sub for all grades in one of the local school systems and for the most part I’ve always had a pretty easy/good day. Today I was subbing at one of the middle schools, one that I’ve been in multiple times and also one that has given me most of my not so great days. I was already having a bad start since I had started my period and was in horrible pain, I was almost late because of it. I got to my class and had VERY simple instructions for the students to get on their class page and do a review for their upcoming test on Tuesday. I already knew it was gonna be trouble because for some reason these kids are allergic to doing THE SIMPLEST TASKS. I had to ask them repeatedly to stay on task, not to throw trash, not move seats, not to copy off one another, stop talking so much and so loudly as well as all the other things you tell your kids not to do. Second period was the same, and so was third. The teacher from across the call warned me about third period and I kid you not. They spent 20, almost 30 mins of class passing around, buying snacks from one kid specifically. I had already asked them repeatedly to sit down, get to work and leave the stuff alone. They finally got to work eventually but a different kid decided it was his turn to be a distraction and go around talking to people, do some trick he’d learned on tiktok to stick stuff to the walls, that one got the attention of almost everyone in class and half the kids stood up and did it too. I told them again that they needed to sit and do their work all but that one same kid sat down and still did the same thing he was doing. The next class all acted like their computers didn’t work and talked and gossiped the whole class. Also got distracted by snacks/candy (all of which the school gives to them btw) and 5th period was the same as them. They have some weird club type thing that goes on during school and the teacher across the hall and I combined and just let them watch a movie. They talked the entire time. They dismissed a little after that. I lost it when I started driving home. I was sobbing. Still am as I’m typing this. The day before I was at the same school for a different teacher and during 2nd or 3rd period we heard a loud pop and a scream. I immediately shut the door and closed the small window to it. The kids and I were all terrified, I told them to get away from the windows and we stayed silent for a couple minutes. Thank God nothing seemed to be happening and nothing came on over the announcements and we heard the class next to us laughing and singing (chorus class) so I assumed we were fine after a while and we were. I guess some kids were just messing around with something in the halls. But I remembered how scared a was in that moment on my way home today and it made me feel 100x worse. I don’t want to die in a school with a bunch of stupid, ungrateful, disrespectful kids. But I love it most days and I’m not sure what to do anymore. Sorry for the long post, thanks for your time if you made it here and please tell me how you get through it. Because I really do love it.",

I don't.

But two of my students with the lowest test scores have some of the most involved parents. They're actually staff members at the school who I know well.

And I find it so hard to not focus more on the social emotional needs of the students in my classroom, knowing that the kids who are lower on paper have and will have more support.\n\n  \nI had a student who scored well on a standardized test but threw angry fits every day in class at the start of the year because he was incapable of regulating his emotions. He is now a leader in the class and gets to play assistant teacher and help other students. He hasn't had an outburst in weeks. That doesn't show up on the tests. Two of my little girls talked to other students about respect during recess. That doesn't show up on the tests. One of the lower scoring kids now reads for fun.

    "text": "Sub. Teacher/English student. Idk what to do anymore. I (24f) need advice, idk if I just had a bad day and it pushed me to my breaking point or if I just need to vent. I’m a Secondary English ed. Student at my local college, my friends told me I should try substitute teaching as extra experience since I had been teetering on whether or not I wanted to do this. I started in February of this year and honestly loved it. I sub for all grades in one of the local school systems and for the most part I’ve always had a pretty easy/good day. Today I was subbing at one of the middle schools, one that I’ve been in multiple times and also one that has given me most of my not so great days. I was already having a bad start since I had started my period and was in horrible pain, I was almost late because of it. I got to my class and had VERY simple instructions for the students to get on their class page and do a review for their upcoming test on Tuesday. I already knew it was gonna be trouble because for some reason these kids are allergic to doing THE SIMPLEST TASKS. I had to ask them repeatedly to stay on task, not to throw trash, not move seats, not to copy off one another, stop talking so much and so loudly as well as all the other things you tell your kids not to do. Second period was the same, and so was third. The teacher from across the call warned me about third period and I kid you not. They spent 20, almost 30 mins of class passing around, buying snacks from one kid specifically. I had already asked them repeatedly to sit down, get to work and leave the stuff alone. They finally got to work eventually but a different kid decided it was his turn to be a distraction and go around talking to people, do some trick he’d learned on tiktok to stick stuff to the walls, that one got the attention of almost everyone in class and half the kids stood up and did it too. I told them again that they needed to sit and do their work all but that one same kid sat down and still did the same thing he was doing. The next class all acted like their computers didn’t work and talked and gossiped the whole class. Also got distracted by snacks/candy (all of which the school gives to them btw) and 5th period was the same as them. They have some weird club type thing that goes on during school and the teacher across the hall and I combined and just let them watch a movie. They talked the entire time. They dismissed a little after that. I lost it when I started driving home. I was sobbing. Still am as I’m typing this. The day before I was at the same school for a different teacher and during 2nd or 3rd period we heard a loud pop and a scream. I immediately shut the door and closed the small window to it. The kids and I were all terrified, I told them to get away from the windows and we stayed silent for a couple minutes. Thank God nothing seemed to be happening and nothing came on over the announcements and we heard the class next to us laughing and singing (chorus class) so I assumed we were fine after a while and we were. I guess some kids were just messing around with something in the halls. But I remembered how scared a was in that moment on my way home today and it made me feel 100x worse. I don’t want to die in a school with a bunch of stupid, ungrateful, disrespectful kids. But I love it most days and I’m not sure what to do anymore. Sorry for the long post, thanks for your time if you made it here and please tell me how you get through it. Because I really do love it.",

    "text": "I sabotaged s PBIS event and I don’t regret it Tuesday night we get an email about next week’s grade level “PBIS” event. \n\nNormally admin collect school bucks during lunch. This time they asked teachers to do it. Oh, and we are told that only the first 150 students could attend. There are 360 in the grade. I teach 140 of them. We have three teams. \n\nI was out for a two weeks due to a family members health failing and eventual passing. The sub said the students were great and my room was in one piece when I returned. So I decided they all deserved to go. I printed out the 10 school bucks for each of my 140 students. Typed in all of their names in the Google form the night we got the email. And stole all the spots. Maybe that makes me an AH. Maybe I’m just protecting my students.\n\nEither way, admin wasn’t pleased with only one team going. So they sent a new email.\n\nNow each team only gets 50 slots. \n\nWhich means nearly 100 of my students can no longer attend. This is not PBIS. \n\nSo I decided my team should boycott the event and do our own. Students who really want to go can, but we are going to show movies and supply our own treats. Hardly any want to go any more from our team. Our kids actually like us for the most part and love the idea of a little classroom party which they don’t get much in middle school.\n\nApparently i pissed off a lot of people.",

    "text": "Confused about post-observation remarks Hello everyone. I would love your input.\n\nI am in my first year of teaching here in the US (teaching since 2001 in Europe). I have a SC ASD room with 7 students and 2 paras. This is the 1st time the school/district has had ASD rooms. There is no curriculum and the paras are not trained.\nI was given $250 to get materials for my room (I had nothing) and I must have spent another $2000, easy, to get what I need and I still probably need another $2000 ...\n\nI have complained about my para many times. Long story short, they do their 2nd job while \"working\" in my room. This is documented. They do NOTHING. They are out of the room for at least 1 hr every day. Lunches are at least an hr (we each get 30 mins), they are on their phone while \"working\" with students and a \"quick run to the bathroom\" is at least 20 minutes long.\n\nI had my 2nd observation of the year last week. I was alone with 6 students and a High Schooler from the LINKS program who I was responsible for when my boss came. I also had a student who was dropped off for a full day (this is a half-day kiddo) and this changed the dynamic of our room plus I had no materials for them as they were not supposed to be there, so it was chaotic.\n\nMy observation remarks are... confusing. I got \"not effective\" and \"minimally effective\" for a couple of areas and highly effective for others.\nNow here is the confusing part: the areas I got not effective/minimally effective, were not because I *was* that, but hecause I was alone. \nI was working one on one with each student which is usually how we roll because of how vastly different my kiddos are. Youngest is 4, oldest is 7.5. We do some group stuff, but when it comes to academics, it has to be 1:1.\n\nMy boss said I don't have what I need to do my job, materials, curriculum and paras, so they are working with the district to get me that, and they said I work very hard and don't stop .. but there is just one of me, so while I can effectively teach 1 kiddo at a time with great results, I was scored not/minimally effective because while working with 1 student, the rest were quietly and calmly doing free play.\n\nI am SO confused. This is a very high needs support room. It NEEDS a staff of 3 and I was alone and still my kiddos were well behaved, working, respectful, happy and the overall progress they have made is tremendous... how is this not effective/minimally effective? Everybody says my room has made amazing progress/is the best behaved/higher achieving of all 3 rooms.\nAnd what does that mean for my future? (Last observation I got high marks but I was NOT alone that day or had students dropped off unexpectedly outside of their regular schedule). My boss has zero worries about my room and always commends how hard I work, how knowledgeable I am, what an amazing climate/culture I have cultivated in my room and how far my students have come... but I got bad scores at the same time because I can't do the work of 3 people(?)",

We have now been told we have to do “accommodation trackers.”\n\nThese are huge spreadsheets for each student that list EVERY SINGLE ACCOMMODATION for each student. We then have to go in every day and click if we provided or did not provide each student’s various accommodation that day. This can easily turn into going through over 20 accommodations for each student. I have over 30 sped students, some of us have over 50. So every day I am supposed to go into over 30 different spreadsheets and fill out each one for each kid all while teaching? Please. What a fucking joke.\n\nThe SPED program, while important, is out of hand. This isn’t realistic. I’m tired of admin cowering to parents over fear of a lawsuit, throwing us to the wolves to figure it out. Does anyone else have to do these trackers?",

These students are allowed to go to the resource room for small group testing and when they come back, there is different hand writing on their tests or I can see that they did not do the work on their own. I am getting extremely frustrated with this as it is unfair to students without IEPs and cannot get extra help on these tests. I don't care if they get a couple of hints for help, but the aide's/teachers are straight up looking up the answers online using ChatGPT and providing that answer and work to those students. ALSO, I know these students do not study, I have asked them before about how much time they spend outside of school studying for tests and they say no because they're too busy with sports or other school after school activities. Some of these students STILL cannot solve simple math problems such as 2x+1=11 and are in Algebra 2 or Geometry. I feel like I am loosing my motivation to continue in education because I came to teach students and sometimes that includes letting them fail so that they learn they need to put some effort into school.\n\nI just needed to rant and see if any of you have any advice on how to deal with this and how to not let it affect you.",

During P/T conferences in November, I scheduled a conference with them. They never showed up. I called and rescheduled it because I really wanted to meet with them. They didn’t show up a second time. I am trying so hard with their student. They called my boss to complain about me because I am “picking on” their child by following my behavior management plan with them. I have made accommodations and even created a whole new behavior management system for their child. It still isn’t enough. The mom was slamming me on social media the other day… Talking about how I’m the worst teacher she’s ever seen, I do nothing for her student and how she’s going to tell them to behave crazy at school just to ruin my life. All because I called her to tell her that her child did not qualify for our monthly behavior reward party. I showed the post to admin and they called her and took care of it. I am not friends with her on Facebook. I was sent the post by a friend who is friends with her on Facebook. \n\nI am off work for a funeral this afternoon. The mom sent me a message and it popped up on my phone. It sent me into full blown panic mode. Just seeing her name pop up made my heart start pounding and made me feel like I could throw up. I cannot comprehend how some people think it is okay to act this way towards their child’s teachers. I understand that some people are hard to please, but it really has worn me down.",

    "text": "Parents don’t realize how much they quietly undo everything we do in the classroom I’ve been teaching for a while now and I’m used to the usual challenges, behavior issues, admin nonsense, lack of resources, all of that comes with the job. What still catches me off guard though is how often the real work I’m doing gets undone at home, not maliciously, not on purpose, just casually. I’ll spend weeks setting clear expectations with a student, working on accountability, follow through, basic responsibility. We talk about consequences, about how actions lead to outcomes, and I’ll see real progress. Then one conversation with a parent happens and suddenly we’re back to square one. I’ll get an email saying their child was “confused” or “felt targeted” when they recieved a consequence that had been clearly explained beforehand. Or the parent will insist their kid was just tired, stressed, hungry, misunderstood, anything except responsible. It’s not even the big blowups that hurt the most, it’s the small steady pattern of parents stepping in to soften every edge of reality. When students know that mom or dad will swoop in and smooth things over, it changes how seriously they take anything we say in class. \n\nThe moment it really hit me was earlier this year with a student who constantly refused to do work. Not disruptive, not loud, just a flat refusal and a shrug. I worked with them, adjusted assignments, checked in privately, documented everything. Eventually I followed our school policy and contacted home. The parent responded with a long message about how school has always been hard for their child, how pressure shuts them down, how consequences make things worse. I empathize with that, truely, but then came the line that stuck with me. They said they told their child that they didn’t actually have to do the assignment if it felt overwhelming and that they supported that decision. The next day the student walked in with a smile I’d never seen before and said “my parent said it’s fine if I don’t do this”. And just like that all structure was gone. I wasn’t angry, I was deflated. Because now I’m not teaching one kid, I’m teaching against an invisible voice at home that’s telling them effort is optional when it’s uncomfortable. Parents often say they want teachers to prepare kids for the real world, but then they shield them from every uncomfortable moment along the way. I know most parents mean well and are trying to protect their kids, but protection without boundaries turns into sabotage. It makes our jobs harder and honestly it doesn’t help the kids either. Sometimes I wish parents could see that we’re not the enemy, we’re not out to get their child, we’re trying to help them grow, and growth is messy and frustrating and sometimes hard. When that gets erased at home, it feels like trying to build something on sand, no matter how carefully you work.",

    "text": "Looking for info on becoming a teacher (MA) Hi guys!! I just had a few questions about what I should be looking forward to with this ‘new’ career path. \n\nFor context, I am currently an EEC childcare teacher. I am certified as a teacher, I have all my coursework to be a Lead Teacher but I am not old enough yet. I’ve been working with the little ones for almost 3 years and I have decided I cannot handle the preschoolers anymore, they have such BIG emotions and struggle with regulating them. We have parents who want their children potty trained but won’t work with them at home and expect us to do it all with the few hours we see their children and there isn’t enough support in the classrooms. \n\nTeaching is my passion though and I’ve been interested in it from a young age so I don’t want to dismiss the career as a whole because the younger age group wasn’t for me. I am currently in college getting ready to switch my major from Early Childhood Education to Elementary Education because I think 2nd grade and up might be my calling. I just want to know what I should expect, not just with the children but with admins, getting a job, etc. \n\nI’m in Massachusetts and I’ve done some research so I believe once I get my associates degree I can become a substitute or assistant teacher until i’ve gotten my bachelors/masters degree. I think I have to pass an MTEL exam as well too but would anyone be able to tell me everything else I need to know. I’ve also heard (from my co workers) that I don’t really need my masters or bachelors because everywhere is so desperate for teachers but I would like an opinion from everyone else!!",

We have a smiley system chart. Parents are aware and have seen doctors to fix the issue. I am leaning towards this being a behavior issue as, despite lots of support, reassurance, and positive reinforcement, it is still happening.\n\nI am very torn between wanting to reward their good behaviors with treasure box versus revoke the treasure box from this student until we see some change. It feels harsh though, but I am struggling to see other alternatives.\n\nIf anyone has had similar experiences or has any good advice on how to manage a problem like this, that would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I’m looking at it all wrong. SOS please help!!!\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented with their perspectives and insight. Rest assured my friend did indeed get their treasure box today, they do a great job of earning it weekly and in hindsight I might’ve not been my best self today in considering taking it away. They clearly don’t deserve that as a consequence for something they can’t help, thank you fellow teachers/parents/supports/Redditors for shaking some sense into a crashing out tired teacher on a Friday after a long busy week. I have a lot to sort out suggestions wise to present on Monday and we do have Winter break coming up in a week, so my hope is there will definitely be some improvement by next year. Til then, we will hang tight, keep supporting and uplifting, and working with the student and their family as we move forward. Have a great weekend, people!",

But in the past it never was truly an option for me because somewhere deep down I knew I could keep going, or I felt some hope or excitement for the potential future. This year has been too much. The kids are a lot. I teach high school ELA and the weight I must bear from needy students who are reading at the grade school level, those frequently absent, and those who are just plain irresponsible (or some perfect storm of all three) topped off with entitled parents and a system that is so rigid in its curriculum I think has broken my spirit.

I don’t think next semester is going to get any better as this batch up students are so disrespectful, apathetic, and irresponsible. Everyday and every lesson feels demoralizing.

I provide reading intervention in small groups and push in for whole group instruction, so I see a wide range of students at different ability levels.\n\nThe 2nd grade class I push into is on UFLI lesson 86. My intervention group, some of whom are in that same class, is on UFLI lesson 52, and may have to go back and repeat lessons because they still aren't getting it.\n\nAcross all 3 grade levels I pull from, around 50% of the class gets pulled out for reading intervention. They're leagues behind their peers, yet whole group instruction just carries on. They can't understand the new concepts because the new concepts build on old concepts and they haven't mastered those yet either. \n\nClassroom teachers are told they need to conduct a whole group UFLI lesson, then repeat that lesson again in a small group for remediation. But what good does repeating the lesson do when the kids can't access the material? Kids who can't reliably recognize digraphs aren't gonna comprehend multisyllabic words no matter how many times you repeat the same lesson. They lack the foundation. And there's only so much remediation can do to get them on grade level when they're 20+ concepts behind in the pacing guide.\n\nI used to be one of the folks saying we need to stop just passing kids along but when I look at the data, retention doesn't always produce gains. In fact it rarely does. And when it's not just a small handful of kids behind but half the grade level, how on earth can you retain all those students and still have room for new enrollment? It's not possible. \n\nSo I'm in favor of slowing down. Extend the pacing guide. Spend more time on new concepts so kids get more exposure to the material. It made sense to differentiate instruction for the low kids when there were only a handful in each class but if half the class isn't getting it, the curriculum and pacing need to be adjusted to meet that need. Intervention can't fix that. \n\nI know we live in a frantic world that loves to go fast but that's not how our kids are learning. With recreational reading levels dropping and poverty levels rising, school is often the *only* time kids are exposed to these concepts. They're not being reinforced at home anymore. So rather than using intervention as damage control and debating retention at the end of every year, why don't districts adjust to meet students where they *are*? That's how we get them to where we want them to be!",

When he was a Jedi he didn't even follow most of the code, but dared to correct Ahsoka any time she made a minor mistake. He's the reason most of Star Wars happened. He killed Count Dooku because his old man bestie told him to, and then he wanted to turn to the dark side, with little to no evidence of the Jedi being bad. He trusted an old man who was hinting for the longest time that the Sith was good. The great and powerful Yoda knew and told him to be cautious near Palpatine and spy on him because they thought he was a Sith, which he was. During the clone wars he saw Sith do evil stuff like taking a planet by force and killed anyone who was in their way if this did show they were evil Anakin was 8 when a Sith was trying to kill him and he saw them trying to take a planet which his Wife was the queen of for some time. This just shows Anakin being a bad Judi. The only thing he had to improve was his emotions; he would have saved people, but he just wanted to crash out. Obi-Wan Kenobi let him side with having a wife which is already a big no-no. Anakin told Yoda, and Yoda told him to let it go and not fear it, but of course, he just couldn't listen and had to have his emotions tied with it. This is why he's probably the worst Judi ever don't put this man in the top 5 Judi ever.",

Based on what the developers have written, we can confidently assume the game's story will be set somewhere between 1100 and 1000 BBY. \n\nIn legend, this was the period known as the New Sith Wars. In canon, this period is called the \"Jedi-Sith War.\" It seems to me that the Interdictor-class ship we saw in the teaser served in the Sith/Republic Navy approximately 3,000 years before the game, and this ship is a remnant of that period, which the game's protagonist discovers. \n\nI just hope the game won't take place in the post-Sith War era. It's possible that the story here leads to Darth Bane, and perhaps even the titular protagonist becomes Bane's apprentice. A lot happens during the fall of the Old Republic in the current canon (including Coruscant being conquered by the Sith, and the Mandalorians attacking Coruscant and stealing the Darksaber).

Today is The Game Awards (TGA), an event that awards the best game of the year but also features announcements, including the first full trailer for Jedi Survivor. A few days ago, news came out suggesting we should see a big Star Wars game that's neither Eclipse nor Zero Company, so if it happens, which game are you expecting?\n\nIt could be Jedi 3; the time since the last release is acceptable for a new announcement to launch at the end of next year or the beginning of 2027, but I think not yet. Maybe at Celebration in May, it could be the Kotor remake that hasn't been mentioned in ages, or something completely new that we don't know about. If it's a new game, it could be more narrative-driven, possibly featuring a bounty hunter. I saw the other day that the company behind the original Uncharted creators has a contract to make a Star Wars game, probably after they release Marvel 1943. That could be it. It could also be a game not so much about expanding the universe, but focused on being an awesome Star Wars game without worrying so much about the narrative, something like an enhanced Starfield in Star Wars.\n\nWhat do you think? Is something big coming up?\n\nedit: Fate of the Old Republic was the game that was announced, and while it's interesting, I think there were more exciting options, but yeah, I thought it was cool.\n\nedit 2: As incredible as it may seem, there were 2 games lololololol the second one was Galactic Racer, a racing game in the style of Episode 1, I thought it was fun.",

Where's the KOTOR remake that was announced years ago? Where's Eclipse? I'm so tired of game studios announcing a game, only to reveal that it's only been in developement for a few months. It's either that, or they cancel it entirely (cough Transformers Reactivate cough). Did the trailer look good? Yes. Am I excited that Casey Hudson is making it? Absolutely. But release the shit you already promised before announcing new stuff.\n\nTLDR: It's hard to get excited for a game that might not even come out.

Based on what the developers have written, we can confidently assume the game's story will be set somewhere between 1100 and 1000 BBY. \n\nIn legend, this was the period known as the New Sith Wars. In canon, this period is called the \"Jedi-Sith War.\" It seems to me that the Interdictor-class ship we saw in the teaser served in the Sith/Republic Navy approximately 3,000 years before the game, and this ship is a remnant of that period, which the game's protagonist discovers. \n\nI just hope the game won't take place in the post-Sith War era. It's possible that the story here leads to Darth Bane, and perhaps even the titular protagonist becomes Bane's apprentice. A lot happens during the fall of the Old Republic in the current canon (including Coruscant being conquered by the Sith, and the Mandalorians attacking Coruscant and stealing the Darksaber). We still have a long time to wait for answers.",

    "text": "My Cat has been passing soft stools since October, nothing has helped. Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone might be able to help. \n\nBack in October, my Cat started having loose, soft stools. They’re not full diarrhoea, but they’re very soft and often come with a normal, firm log. This went on for about a week, so we took him to the vet.\n\nFor context, he has a history of urinary issues. Yes he is neutered. A few years ago he had bladder crystals that were blocking the urinary tract. He did have surgery for this, it came back and he went back in, and has been fine ever since, but I wanted to note he had soft stools a few days before this all came about. He HAS been passing urine frequently and without struggle, no signs or symptoms of this repeating. \n\nWhen we took him to the Vets, they said that he was healthy and that his bladder is fine. He asked if he had eaten anything unusual and the only thing I could think of was that I plucked some grass from outside for him to eat, he is an indoor Cat, and I did not know the risks of this when it came to worms. He prescribed a 3 month wormer tablet as a precaution and a 5-day, twice daily probiotic paste, although he suspected it was not worms and we have never seen signs or symptoms of them, nor did he. \n\nAfter finishing the probiotic course, nothing had improved so we went back a week later. The second Vet suggested that it could be stress. I can understand this as we moved in August, and he did stay hidden for a few days, but he came into his own after a while and has never been stressed or shown signs of being stressed since. He is a naturally very nervous Cat, especially around new people. I would assume his stools would stay soft after a Vet visit due to the stress from them anyway, but with them being frequently soft it’s not possible to tell. \n\nThere was nothing prescribed this time, rather she recommended us to buy a couple things from PetsatHome. Fortiflora sachet probiotics and Feliway calming lickylicks. These have not helped.  \n\nI wondered if it was his diet. He was on Felix’s as good as it looks jelly sachets, and Perfect fit sensitive dry. I swapped his Felix to Royal Canin urinary, and after a few days his stools became perfect. However, I also changed his dry a week after to Ultima urinary tract, and now his stools have become soft again, and more so like a ‘cow pat’, without the extra hardened log. He also passes a lot of gas before going, not every time but frequent enough. I want to add his water intake is very high, he has always been a strong drinker, which I assume is linked to his biscuit intake but he only gets a small handful daily. He will clear half a bowl, sometimes more of water daily. \nI feel completely stuck. Nothing has helped, and diet changes have only helped briefly. Is it a case of waiting it out and hoping that it improves? I want to add again that his urine is completely fine. \n\nHe is registered at the PDSA, a charity vet for people who can’t afford full healthcare. I read that a stool sample could be an idea but they do not offer this. If you think it is necessary, is there anywhere that does this privately that won’t cost me an arm and a leg, as I am low income. \n\nI haven’t recent pictures of the stool without the extra log but it’s the same consistency and colour as the ones shown. Please note the second photo was taken with the flash at night, the stool was not this dark or rich in colour. There has been no mucus in the stool. \n\nNotable info:\nCat is 6yo, neutered, PDSA vet, has had previous urinary issues. \n\nTLDR; My 6-year-old neutered indoor cat has had frequent soft stools since October. Vet checks, probiotics, wormers, and calming aids haven’t helped. Diet changes helped briefly but stools softened again. He passes gas frequently when defecting but has normal urine and drinks a lot. I’m not sure if this will resolve on its own or if further action is needed. \n\nMy full thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and offers advice. Thankyou.",

At first ginger was ok with the kitty but month or so later she stared hidding in the cabinet… but the big deal about it is that she wouldn’t come out of it.

He’s my first cat and I haven’t spent much time around cats before, so I don’t have much of a baseline for what’s “normal.” My flatmate and girlfriend, who have both lived with lots of cats, say his behaviour is a bit excessive (we all adore him, don’t worry!).\n\nThe issue: if Leo isn’t asleep, he wants to be physically on someone or he walks around the flat yowling. He’s extremely vocal - everyone who meets him says he’s the loudest cat they’ve ever heard, if you say something to him he almost always responds. If I’m not actively interacting with him, he cries a whole lot, sometimes it's pretty distressing.\n\nI never reward the yowling - always wait until he’s been quiet for a few minutes before engaging with him. \n\nHe’s otherwise healthy, litter is clean, he gets wet/dry meals on a schedule, he has toys, scratchers, and plenty of enrichment. He’s very bonded to me in particular, to the point that other people in the flat feel a bit rejected because he rarely goes to them anymore.\n\nI'm sure this is a much repeated question, sorry. He's an Arabian Mau from the UAE, I've heard they have a reputation for being super loud and energetic. He's a HUGE snuggle bug, just wants to be under the blanket with you 😊\n\nCat tax of course",

She was taken to the vet by one of my neighbors right before she gave birth and she tested negative for FELV and FIV and she was given a dewormer and flea treatment. I already have a strictly indoor cat and he is also negative and he is up to date on his vaccines. It’s unknown if she has hers (guessing not) but we couldn’t get her vaccinated while she was still nursing her babies (vet refused). One of my neighbors took her in so she could give birth and now that the babies are 2 months she’s giving me the mama cat (I would have taken her and babies originally but I was in a small apartment at the time). \n\nI’m picking her up tomorrow and I plan to do slow introductions over the next month or two with her and my cat now. She gets vaccinated on Monday and the vet said to keep them separated for at least 7 days till the vaccines kick in (I plan to keep them separated longer since they’re still in the introduction phase). \n\nMy question is what kind of things shouldn’t she and my current cat share? Like if she lays in her bed and uses her litter box and plays with some toys should I throw these all away once they start doing face to face introductions? How will this affect scent swapping? Should I just wait to do that till her vaccines are in effect? Any tips for during this phase are appreciated. \n\nSorry if it’s a dumb question. I just don’t want either of them to get sick.",

(VIC, Australia) She was at the vet 2 weeks ago and I was told she is perfectly healthy.\n\nIve noticed for the past 3 or 4 days that Possum (my cat) had a bald red spot on her arm, it wasn't bleeding or weeping so I thought a flea allergy (she's indoor and one of my other cats is allergic to fleas) Today I noticed a second one showing up. I cant get into the vet until Wednesday and was wondering if anyone had any advice? I'm not sure if I should put a cone on her.\n\nI am aware that this is not a substitute for a vet, and was just wondering if there is anything I can do until I can get to the vet on Wednesday as we dont have emergency vets in my area, thank you.",

I got a lot of useful comments about how to help but… we found a kitten outside annndddddd…. Things led to another and we got the kitten… I know this was probably the worst choice at the time but I was really depressed cuz my mom and stuff so I want really thinking all to well. At first ginger was ok with the kitty but month or so later she stared hidding in the cabinet… but the big deal about it is that she wouldn’t come out of it. LIVING IN A CABNIT ISNT THE LIFE FOR A CAT. I feel so bad… we can’t send her to a shelter cuz they would kill her but living in a cabnit is bad to.

My vet doesn’t have an xray machine so I had to get them at another clinic. I returned to my original vet and she said she can’t read the hips properly to determine the issue. The other clinic insisted these are the best shots they can take. \n\nI’m at a loss and honestly a little frustrated because xray shots are expensive and they still can’t figure out what’s wrong with my cat. I’d surely take him for another round of xray after a few days but in the meantime, is anyone able to see if there are potential problems in the hips?",

I cannot take this sweet boy in because I already have five male cats. He has been coming to my door for food twice a day for a little over three months now. He sits at my back door like this for a couple of minutes every evening as a way of saying thank you. He plays with toys through the glass.  It’s obvious he wishes to come in.  My other cats are not happy about it.  He is an unneutered male, and to my knowledge there is absolutely nothing wrong with him.  He lets me pick him up, he lets me pet him, he’s even let me put flea and tick medicine on him. This sweetheart deserves a family of his own. \n\nI have not taken him to a vet, and I am going to neuter him as soon as hunting season is over. We live in a very rural place and he is currently sticking to my yard where I am positive, he’s not going to get mistaken for a raccoon or another small animal and killed. I don’t want to chance breaking his trust until hunting season is over.\nMy local shelters are full, so are several rescues I’ve reached out to. The local No Kill Shelter said they would trap neuter release him, but couldn’t guarantee he would be released back here so I couldn’t be sure he’d be fed. It is cold outside and though I have provided him with a heated box And two other secondary shelters.\n\nTLDR: seeking advice on helping a sweet male Stray find a home.",

    "text": "My Cat has been passing soft stools since October, nothing has helped. Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone might be able to help. \n\nBack in October, my Cat started having loose, soft stools. They’re not full diarrhoea, but they’re very soft and often come with a normal, firm log. This went on for about a week, so we took him to the vet.\n\nFor context, he has a history of urinary issues. Yes he is neutered. A few years ago he had bladder crystals that were blocking the urinary tract. He did have surgery for this, it came back and he went back in, and has been fine ever since, but I wanted to note he had soft stools a few days before this all came about. He HAS been passing urine frequently and without struggle, no signs or symptoms of this repeating. \n\nWhen we took him to the Vets, they said that he was healthy and that his bladder is fine. He asked if he had eaten anything unusual and the only thing I could think of was that I plucked some grass from outside for him to eat, he is an indoor Cat, and I did not know the risks of this when it came to worms. He prescribed a 3 month wormer tablet as a precaution and a 5-day, twice daily probiotic paste, although he suspected it was not worms and we have never seen signs or symptoms of them, nor did he. \n\nAfter finishing the probiotic course, nothing had improved so we went back a week later. The second Vet suggested that it could be stress. I can understand this as we moved in August, and he did stay hidden for a few days, but he came into his own after a while and has never been stressed or shown signs of being stressed since. He is a naturally very nervous Cat, especially around new people. I would assume his stools would stay soft after a Vet visit due to the stress from them anyway, but with them being frequently soft it’s not possible to tell. \n\nThere was nothing prescribed this time, rather she recommended us to buy a couple things from PetsatHome. Fortiflora sachet probiotics and Feliway calming lickylicks. These have not helped.  \n\nI wondered if it was his diet. He was on Felix’s as good as it looks jelly sachets, and Perfect fit sensitive dry. I swapped his Felix to Royal Canin urinary, and after a few days his stools became perfect. However, I also changed his dry a week after to Ultima urinary tract, and now his stools have become soft again, and more so like a ‘cow pat’, without the extra hardened log. He also passes a lot of gas before going, not every time but frequent enough. I want to add his water intake is very high, he has always been a strong drinker, which I assume is linked to his biscuit intake but he only gets a small handful daily. He will clear half a bowl, sometimes more of water daily. \nI feel completely stuck. Nothing has helped, and diet changes have only helped briefly. Is it a case of waiting it out and hoping that it improves? I want to add again that his urine is completely fine. \n\nHe is registered at the PDSA, a charity vet for people who can’t afford full healthcare. I read that a stool sample could be an idea but they do not offer this. If you think it is necessary, is there anywhere that does this privately that won’t cost me an arm and a leg, as I am low income. \n\nI haven’t recent pictures of the stool without the extra log but it’s the same consistency and colour as the ones shown. Please note the second photo was taken with the flash at night, the stool was not this dark or rich in colour. There has been no mucus in the stool. \n\nNotable info:\nCat is 6yo, neutered, PDSA vet, has had previous urinary issues. \n\nTLDR; My 6-year-old neutered indoor cat has had frequent soft stools since October. Vet checks, probiotics, wormers, and calming aids haven’t helped. Diet changes helped briefly but stools softened again. He passes gas frequently when defecting but has normal urine and drinks a lot. I’m not sure if this will resolve on its own or if further action is needed. \n\nMy full thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and offers advice. Thankyou.",

    "text": "Caught stray, what's up with her nose? Hi Reddit, new cat rescuer here! Late 20s, started rescuing cats in Australia as my local colony of strays is getting bigger and needs external intervention due to suspected cases of people nearby poisoning cats in the past.\n\nI have a vet appointment scheduled in a few days for this lovely mama kitty (previously a stray, earned the name Houdini). She's eating normally and seems okay regarding behavior/temperament, as do her babies (there's four of them). \n\nI've noticed this mark on her face yesterday, and photos of it today show it being a fair bit bigger than it was previously. I don't notice it in older photos of her from last week, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what this could be?\n\nIncluded some photos from her original capture day to show her face before the photos showing the mark, and am washing hands after handling in case it's ringworm or similar, as well as avoiding touching it. This family of cats have all been bathed with cat shampoo and given dewormer, and Houdini is due for her spay once her babies become fully independent and stop nursing (she's still producing milk, so I'm holding off for now). Plan will be to rehome them once everyone's vaccinated and weaned but wanted to get some advice beforehand.\n\nI can afford vet care at the moment, thankfully! I have resources available for more costly treatments but wanted to see if the good people of Reddit might be able to give pointers on what this is? Obviously will confirm with the vet and update once I know",

She has come out to eat, drink, and use her box but otherwise it’s straight back to the closet.

She had gotten into the car engine and got sliced up pretty bad 4 years ago, lost sight in her right eye and lacerations all on that side.

    "text": "[READ THIS FIRST] r/CATHELP Rules Reminder [Hello there](https://giphy.com/gifs/sr8jYZVVsCmxddga8w)\n\nDue to a growing number of cat crises and a surprising number of people who [cannot read a sidebar](https://giphy.com/gifs/computer-cat-wearing-glasses-VbnUQpnihPSIgIXuZv), we’re now regularly posting this rules reminder. This is here to prevent both:\n\n1. repeat[ offenses](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZ3ViMzRwcjF2c2t4ZDZha3Nzc3oyMWl6c3ZrMHUwc2VhaWl2N2wwOSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/YrL6i2ADGf52E/giphy.gif), and\n2. the inevitable [“I didn’t know!”](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExc3lnNXdtdm5lYXR4N29xZDZjYmozaXNoOGMxcXQwMGZ1MjQ2b2pxeCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3kzJvEciJa94SMW3hN/giphy.gif) mod mail we get *after* your post/comment disappears into the void.\n\nIf you're new (hi, welcome, pet your cat for us), or returning and rusty, please take a sec to read this. It’ll save you—and us—a lot of headache.\n\n# **STRIKE POLICY: Break the rules once? We warn you. Break twice? Temp ban. 3 strikes is a perma-ban (unless you're a mega troll).**\n\n# 1. BE NICE\n\nNo, really. Be *nice*. You are talking to someone who is probably stressed, worried about their pet/a stray, and sleep-deprived. Reddit is not your venting space to shame people who are already anxious. Educate, don’t humiliate.  \nThis includes a **zero-tolerance policy** for berating or shaming OPs. If you can't say it kindly, don't say it here.\n\nIn addition to this, know that we get posts from **all over the world**. Sometimes it's people who live in a village, 500km from any formal vet care. Often it's a minor who cannot make a unilateral decision for the cat in question. Be compassionate! Bullying them won't help the cat.\n\n# 2. NO SOAPBOXING OR OFF-TOPIC DEBATE\n\n[(Definition of 'SOAPBOXING' here.)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soapboxing) Yes, letting your cats outdoors isn't great for the environment. But this isn’t a debate club, and PLENTY of things harm the environment besides cats. People come here from all over the world, with different cultures around how cats are cared for. People come here about strays. **No preaching!! Take your cat care bible elsewhere!** Either give OP helpful advice *about their issue* or move along.\n\nDon’t derail threads with politics, don’t pick fights across multiple comments, and definitely don’t start fights with the mod team. We don’t get paid enough.\n\n# 3. VET FIRST, REDDIT SECOND\n\nIf your cat is injured, bleeding, gasping, or pooping blood—*call a vet*.  \nReddit is great for guidance, second opinions, and shared experience. It is **not a substitute for veterinary care**.  \nIf you haven't called a vet yet, our advice might be limited.  \nCan’t afford one? Look into:  \n• Payment plans or CareCredit  \n• Local rescues and shelters for assistance  \n• Low-cost clinics in your area\n\nStill post if you need to—but know that our first advice will probably be: **call your vet.**\n\n**Additional note to commenters: no 'Vet. Now.' comments will be allowed without context. If you think they need immediate care, explain why. Otherwise it's just creating panic and those comments will be removed.**\n\n# 4. NO FUNDRAISERS\n\nSorry, but GoFundMes, Venmos, PayPals, and “please help save Coco” links are not allowed, even in comments. Too many scams, and too hard to moderate. Try subs like r/Assistance or r/GoFundMe instead.\n\n# 5. NO BULLYING POOR PEOPLE\n\nWe get it. Vet care is expensive. It's frustrating to see cats suffering. But **complaining about people who can’t afford a vet is not allowed.** Full stop.  \nSuggest rehoming? Fine. But if you’re here to shame people for being broke, please find another sub.\n\nIf someone is struggling financially, ER visits are not really something they can just save up for, nor is it realistic to expect them to just get rid of their pets they have emotionally attachments to. All we can hope for is people really think long and hard about how a pet will fit into their finances before they decide to adopt or take in an animal from street. You simply can’t help them all, there are too many cats for that.\n\n# 6. TAG YOUR GORE NSFW\n\nBloody wound? Surgery pics? Graphic medical stuff? Weird rash? GAPING FUCKING WOUND?! **Mark it NSFW**.  \nThat includes genitalia (gender ID posts) and poop/vom. You know who you are.\n\n# 7. ON-TOPIC POSTS ONLY\n\nThis is not r/aww or r/cats. This is r/CATHELP. We are here for:\n\n* Requesting anecdotal experience with medical issues •\n* Behavior issues\n* General advice\n* First-time cat owner questions (yes, 'noob' questions are welcome!)\n\nThat means:\n\n* No “What should I name my cat?”\n* No “Look at my cat in a hat!”\n* No memes, no fluff.\n\n*Posts that don’t have a clear help-related question will be removed.*\n\n# 8. NO BREED QUESTIONS\n\nUnless your cat came with pedigree paperwork from a breeder, they’re a domestic short/medium/long hair. That’s it.  \nWe don't do breed speculation. Why? Because it’s almost always wrong, and it clogs up the sub.  \nWant to know more? Here's a [guide to fur patterns](https://sheltermedicine.vetmed.ufl.edu/files/2011/11/identification-and-coat-colors-patterns.pdf), and here's a [general answer to 'what breed is my cat'](https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/hc0jny/an_answer_to_the_faq_what_breed_is_my_cat/)\n\n# 9. NO SHITPOSTING, NO KARMA FARMING\n\nIf your post is clearly made up, AI-generated, or you’re just farming karma with a low-effort fake, we will yeet it. And probably you, too.\n\n# 10. NO BRIGADING\n\nIf you don’t like someone’s post, do not go hunt them down on other subreddits to insult them. It’s petty, it’s bannable, and Reddit takes it seriously.\n\n# 11. NO PET SALES OR BREEDING\n\nWe do **not** support the cat trade or backyard breeders. Period.  \nDon’t try to sell or give away pets here. Don’t ask about breeding. Don’t promote purebred aesthetics. Shelter cats are just as cute.\n\n# BONUS REMINDERS\n\n• If your **posts or comments are disappearing**, check your karma. If it's low, Automod probably ate it. Message us for manual approval.  \n• If you **see rule-breaking behavior**, REPORT IT. Automod can’t catch everything.  \n• If you’re confused or unsure, check the \\[wiki\\] or send us a modmail.  \n• **Read the stickied comment** on your post. It’s there for a reason.\n\n**TL;DR: Help cats. Be nice. No scams. No BS. Read the rules.**  \nNow go pet your cat. They probably knocked something off the counter while you were reading this.",

I’ve done my research and it seems really fatal. We had her since she was 2 weeks old so the vet said she was most likely born with it as we never had other cats around. The vet though said she had perfect vitals, so they had hope for her as sometimes they can live long and prosperous lives like magic johnson if u feel me. But I also have another kitten, probably 3 months old. Hes getting his blood done today, and is perfectly healthy and doesn’t show signs of anything, but most likely has it as they are always around eachother. Just be honest with me guys. How long do I have? These are my first cats, I’ve wanted them since I was a little girl. I’m devastated. I can’t go without my babies. I want my babies. Anyone experience this before? Especially with a cat that where else has perfect vitals, and the kitten who shows no symptoms? I’m devastated. I’m devastated.",

I got a lot of useful comments about how to help but… we found a kitten outside annndddddd…. Things led to another and we got the kitten… I know this was probably the worst choice at the time but I was really depressed cuz my mom and stuff so I want really thinking all to well. At first ginger was ok with the kitty but month or so later she stared hidding in the cabinet… but the big deal about it is that she wouldn’t come out of it. LIVING IN A CABNIT ISNT THE LIFE FOR A CAT. I feel so bad… we can’t send her to a shelter cuz they would kill her but living in a cabnit is bad to.

She has come out to eat, drink, and use her box but otherwise it’s straight back to the closet. A part of me wonders if it’s in reaction to how cold it is and the pressure changes (where I live is currently in a polar vortex) because she has a prior injury from when she was my grandmothers cat. She had gotten into the car engine and got sliced up pretty bad 4 years ago, lost sight in her right eye and lacerations all on that side. She recovered but I’m wondering if those wounds are hurting her again. I live in the us, vet care isn’t really an option because I’m dead broke. Poe is about 7 years old, female and spayed.",

I (F21) live in South Africa. Two weeks ago I adopted my kitty Milo. He is 9 (going onto 10) weeks old. He’s been vaccinated and dewormed before I got him. He’s diet consists mainly of hydrated dry food. I usually use wet food as a treat when training/grooming him. This means he doesn’t get more than a teaspoon of wet food at a time. However, the past few days I’ve seen people say that giving them wet food in the mornings is really good for them. So I tried it. My issue is that since I started mixing wet food into he’s breakfast bowl (about 2 teaspoons) he has been getting diarrhoea. It doesn’t matter what flavour I put, he still reacts to it. He doesn’t seem to be in pain or discomfort, he just messes all over his litter box and floor. I’m unsure on whether I need to take him to the vet or if he’s stomach just doesn’t agree with wet food. He isn’t insured yet and while I can afford a vet bill when absolutely necessary, I can’t use my savings if it’s not a big issue.  If anyone has any advice for me because cleaning and washing my entire home is a mission. For now I’m going to keep him off the wet food since it is definitely the culprit.",

We’ve done initial vet check (vaccines/deworming started) but these last days he got worse, picky eating or not eating at all some days, he stopped playing, has stinky breath and yesterday night he didn’t even sleep. We went back to the vet and had a fever and sore throat. The vet gave us some medicine and said it’s probably FHV.\n\nI’m worried this could even be something heavier like FIV, but he’s too young to get tested.\n\nDo you have any similar experience? Will it always be like that or it’s maybe just some adjustment stress? Will it get better when he gets older?\n\nAnd do you think insurance will cover the cat expenses? Thanks!",

    "text": "Pine Pellet Litter My cat recently got litter stuck in her paw so badly that it matted into her fur, and we had to take her to the vet to get it removed. To prevent this from happening again, the vet recommended switching to a permanent 50/50 mix of clumping clay litter and pine pellets.\n\nThe problem is: I can’t figure out how to scoop/clean this combination.\n\nWith clumping litter, I normally shake the scoop so the clean, small pieces fall back into the box. With pine pellets, everything I’ve read says to scoop out the urine-soaked sawdust and shake the scoop so the sawdust falls through into the disposal bag or Litter Genie, while keeping the intact pellets in the box.\n\nThese two methods seem like the exact opposite of each other, so I’m confused about how to clean a box that has both at the same time. Has anyone figured out a good system for keeping a mixed litter box clean?",

    "text": "Cats have been fighting(?) ever since our family friend died **TLDR;** *Our close family friend drowned 1.5 months ago. Ever since we got the news, cat (8F) has been lashing out at cat (12F). I wonder whether I'm overreacting and if there's a solution to this.* \n\nOn the noon of late October this year, we learnt that our family friend (F44) had drowned and gotten hospitalised. That same evening my stepfather's cat, Socks, (8F) started physically lashing out at my Maine Coon, Baby, (12F) by chasing her around the house, cornering her, and slapping her. And she has kept up this behaviour every night since. \n\nOur family friend died a few days later in the hospital. Socks has always been a nervous wreck and had a temper, but lashing out at Baby like this is completely new. My stepfather theories that Socks is sensing us being upset/stressed (by smelling stress hormones) and responds by lashing out at an easy target, Baby, to release her own stress. \n\nWe have done our very best to accommodate Socks' comfort and needs. There have been many other and more significant losses in our family in the past, so we've arguably gotten \"used to\" losing loved ones. Hence we have been coping well with this incident. No crying, no screaming, no arguing or anything like that. But even though we cope, it still affects us emotionally. \n\nIt's now about one and a half month since our family friend died and I'd say things have definitely started to return to normal. Yet Socks continues lashing out at Baby every single night. Usually from 20:00 until we go to bed around 00:00. \n\nTo me it doesn't look like Baby is enjoying it. It's always one-sided with Socks barrelling after Baby and Baby desperately trying to get away. Their tails are down and Socks sometimes puff her tail. There has even been incidents where Baby goes upstairs to use her litter box only for Socks to follow her and starts lashing out at Baby *in the litter box* while Baby's *doing her business.* However, there's no jowling, just a few whimpers from Baby. They haven't physically injured each other either (that I'm aware of at least).\n\nMy stepfather and mom appears completely uninterested in addressing Socks' behaviour. \n&gt; \"It's just how Socks is. Besides, Baby is so resilient anyway, so just let Socks do what she wants.\"\n\nWould you guys consider this problematic or am I overreacting? Is there anything to do about this?\n\nEdit for additional info: Both cats are neutered. They're outdoor cats (meaning they have access to the outdoors, but stay mostly inside by choice).",

    "text": "My kittens tummy reacts to wet food? Hi everyone! \n\nFor context I’m a first time cat mom and while I did as much research as I could before leaping into this. I (F21) live in South Africa. Two weeks ago I adopted my kitty Milo. He is 9 (going onto 10) weeks old. He’s been vaccinated and dewormed before I got him. He’s diet consists mainly of hydrated dry food. I usually use wet food as a treat when training/grooming him. This means he doesn’t get more than a teaspoon of wet food at a time. However, the past few days I’ve seen people say that giving them wet food in the mornings is really good for them. So I tried it. My issue is that since I started mixing wet food into he’s breakfast bowl (about 2 teaspoons) he has been getting diarrhoea. It doesn’t matter what flavour I put, he still reacts to it. He doesn’t seem to be in pain or discomfort, he just messes all over his litter box and floor. I’m unsure on whether I need to take him to the vet or if he’s stomach just doesn’t agree with wet food. He isn’t insured yet and while I can afford a vet bill when absolutely necessary, I can’t use my savings if it’s not a big issue.  If anyone has any advice for me because cleaning and washing my entire home is a mission. For now I’m going to keep him off the wet food since it is definitely the culprit.",

    "text": "Won’t bury poo and scratches everything OK, hi everyone I’ve never posted here before but I am a 26-year-old female, I am married and I have two kids and I own my own home. I’m posting from the US. I do have vet access and I can afford it, and my cat has been fully vetted and she’s perfectly healthy and fine. There’s nothing wrong with her she’s just a little silly. I guess. She is spayed and she is about 11 months old.\n\nAnyway, what’s going on is that this cat refuses to bury her excrement in the litter box and it’s driving me nuts. Sometimes she’ll even poo outside of the box for NO REASON. The box will be perfectly clean. I’ve tried all kinds of variations for the litter box // covered, uncovered in one of those furniture boxes so that it doesn’t smell as bad. Nothing works. It’s always the same situation as she does the same thing. I change it frequently. I scoop it all the time and it’s always clean - this is driving me insane, especially the smell every time she goes. (healthy solid poops but stinky)\n\nMore about her: She is a rescued cat. We rescued her around the time she was maybe one month old - abandoned by her mom and her eyes were barely open. We bottle fed around the clock until we could supplement her soft food with milk replacement powder and then transition to hard kibble. Even with her first tiny litter box she’s never buried her waste - I even showed her how in many different ways many times, no luck.\n\nI have one other cat that’s also a rescue. We’ve had her for seven years and she is such a good cat. She doesn’t scratch anything. She doesn’t get on table. She uses the litter box perfectly and she’s just a wonderful cat to have. This new cat that my kids insisted on us keeping is a nightmare and it’s driving me insane not only the litter box incidents, but she scratches everything including my vintage kitchen chairs that have almost been destroyed. I try regularly cutting her nails, shooing her away from the chair shooing her away from our couch, and all the other things she scratches on etc. but nothing works. I’ve also tried the claw caps on her and she sat there for hours and chewed them all off within the first few hours she had them on. We have cat scratchers and toys galore. Idk what to do about this cat!! I love her - but fml!\n\nNot only that, but she’s also not very sociable. She doesn’t come up to you. You have to go up to her and even then sometimes she runs away from you. She’s finicky with affection and it sucks. I’d tolerate all of this maybe if she were a sweet baby lol. I just don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nAt this point, I just don’t think she’s a good fit for us or our family and it’s driving me up the walls because I love her and the kids love her, but I don’t know what to do because I can’t keep going with how it’s going. Any advice is appreciated. I don’t need hate here because I truly do everything I can for our cats and they are beyond spoiled.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: She also scratches my kids and their faces and that’s unacceptable….. she does it playfully/ accidentally but still worrisome with bacteria, cat scratch fever, etc…",

Intro was going great with the resident cats.\n\nOne resident cat got extremely sick at first; $2500 later and a day away from being put on a feeding tube she seems to be on the mend.

The shelter cat had a clean bill of health but after my first cat literally almost died now the second weaker one is showing the same symptoms. I am freaking out. Is there anything I can do to support him while he goes through this illness too? I just called the ER who helped with cat 1 and waiting for them to call back. I feel absolutely terrible.\n\nEdit - btw, I was in and out of the ER all week. They finally did an endoscopy on my resident cat and found lots of inflammation on her larynx suggestive of a viral infection.

Except the first days, he was generally playful and eating well on a structured schedule, of course slept a lot, but has always been kinda sick, sneezing and always had eye discharge. We’ve done initial vet check (vaccines/deworming started) but these last days he got worse, picky eating or not eating at all some days, he stopped playing, has stinky breath and yesterday night he didn’t even sleep. We went back to the vet and had a fever and sore throat. The vet gave us some medicine and said it’s probably FHV.\n\nI’m worried this could even be something heavier like FIV, but he’s too young to get tested.\n\nDo you have any similar experience? Will it always be like that or it’s maybe just some adjustment stress? Will it get better when he gets older?\n\nAnd do you think insurance will cover the cat expenses? Thanks!",

He is very beautiful but absolutely HATES me for no reason.\n\nFor the last few years, every time I come to visit them, the cat arches his back, hisses at me, and often will try to pounce/bite/scratch me totally unprovoked.\n\nLet me be totally clear: I completely leave this cat alone. I don’t try to pet him, I don’t try to pick him up, I try not to even look at him! Yet by simply existing, walking to the kitchen, or walking to the bathroom, he freaks out that I am there and starts kind of “hunting” me. If I spend the night, he’s waiting outside the bedroom door for me to use the restroom in the middle of the night to “hunt” me all over again. Like I’ll have the door closed and he’ll swipe his paw under the door the whole time 😅\n\nNow that I’m pregnant, I’m a little more worried about the injuries from getting bitten/scratched, and also I’m just kinda bummed that my dad’s beloved cat hates me so much.

She is agitated and fights with everyone except her mother. As soon as she feels her newly spayed sister near her, she whistles and behaves aggressively. She has also stopped purring. Today I even picked her up and she scratched her under the eye. Never done that before. Could you tell me why? Thanks in advance 💔",

    "text": "Cat keeping roommate up all night Hi reddit! \n\nSo my sweet 13 year old boy, Monty, and I moved in with a new roommate in July. He has a touch of separation anxiety and spends 10-15 minutes crying every time I leave the apartment. That's not the issue though.\n\nMonty is a very rude little gentleman, so I have to kick him out of my room at night, or else he will wake me up every hour or so.\nEvery once in a while, I'd sleep with my door open so we can get some good cuddles in, and then partway through the night when he inevitably bites my nose or tries to nurse my hair, I'd kick him out and that was that.  Nobody I've ever lived with has had any problem with this, he used to meow for 10-15 minutes and then move on. \n\nWELL that changed when we moved in here. TL;DR, I caught my roommate opening my door while I was asleep to let my cat in when he meowed at my door. Completely undoing years of training to NOT meow incessantly at the door which he did with his previous owners and I had to train out of him.\n\nI told him it was inappropriate what he was doing, and that it was going to take months of letting him meow it out now to retrain him, especially as he's a senior kitty. I thought that was that, but now my roommate is giving me reports on nightly meowing and expecting it to be solved instantly. He also meows and yowls for hours on end, which he didn't do before. \n\nWhat do I do??",

    "text": "Cat behavior Advice Needed **Poster Age:** I am 18, and need advice/help on my cats behavior.\n\n**Country**: Posting from USA\n\n**Vet info:** Not really needed in this situation\n\n**Main Issue:** Cat is sweet and curious but sometimes exhibits arrogant behaviors of trying to scratch us or causing trouble (at a bigger scale not small stuff like not giving her food) when things don't go her way. \n\n**Cat Age:** A little over 2 years. \n\n**Cat Sex + neuter info:** Both cats in story female and spayed.\n\n**Financial situation:** Can afford vetcare along as its reasonable and not in the thousands.  \n  \nHello, this is my second time posting on Reddit. I read all of the rules, so I think I should be good?? I have a behavioral concern with one of my cats. I have 2 cats that we got from separate people ever since they were 2-3 months old (both a little over 2 years now), but one of them has been causing issues with us for a while. I know this may be controversial, but both of my cats are indoor-outdoor cats, and I make sure they are home safe every night. Let’s call the cat I am writing this in regard to Lily. Lily is what I would call a sweet and curious cat who has a bit too much attitude. She seems to be highly intelligent and often likes to accompany me when I am making crafts or when my dad is working on cars, and so on. From when she was born to when we picked her up, she spent a lot of time around people, as she used to live in an auto shop. This has translated her into being fearless and a bit arrogant when going outside — something my other cat doesn’t do.  \n  \nOver the past 2 years, we have gotten several reports from our neighbors/friends that she sometimes tries to get into their house. One of our neighbors had said that she pooped in their garage because they wouldn’t pet her (I think she was slightly allergic to cats). Lily also likes to lie on the neighbor's lawn to annoy their dogs because she doesn’t like them. I know this sounds very trashy on our part as we are the ones who let her outside, but ever since we found out it is a problem, we have tried to change it. The problem is that now she is accustomed to going outdoors - it is the highlight of both of my cats' days to go outside, explore, and do cat things. There is no way to keep her indoors full-time now, so the only option was to let her out at night (with a window open for her to get back into the house whenever she wanted to) or give her back to the guy we got her from. This during this past summer, and the first option seemed to have worked. For the first few weeks, we would only let her out during the night, but we have slowly transitioned back to her previous schedule. I don't think it is a problem right now as its winter and cold (so they don't spend much time outdoors), but I am worried these problems will arise again this next upcoming spring and summer.  \n  \nMy mom was very unhappy with my cat’s behavior, which is completely understandable because it is so embarrassing and incredibly wrong on our part to be letting her out and having her cause trouble for our neighbors. I wonder if there was a way we could train her to stop trying to go into other people's houses. This summer, a month after that altercation where we found out she pooped in my neighbor's garage, lily did end up going missing for about a week. When she came back, she was more timid. This may sound bad, but this was good, as her attitude died down and she stopped trying to get into people's houses. I will touch back more on this later.  \n  \nThe real reason I am making this post is that this morning, my dad was lying on the couch and Lily came up to him because she wanted to get pet. He loves cats very much, and was petting her where she wanted him to pet her, which was on the head. After a few minutes, she suddenly swung at him with her nails, and that was that. Luckily, my dad didn't get scratched, but there is the concern that she could scratch someone’s eye out like that. \n\n  \nNow, I wouldn’t say this is completely unlike her behavior, as I mentioned, she has an attitude and thinks she runs things. But usually, she comes to cuddle with me at least once a day, and doesn’t exhibit such behaviors. I will say that she will usually only cuddle with me for 5-15 minutes until she gets overstimulated and then moves somewhere close by to sleep. I am thinking that she got overstimulated with my dad and thus swung at him, but even so, I feel that that is still unacceptable and unnatural for her to do. My dad would’ve stopped if he knew she was getting tired, so there was no reason for her to swing at him, as she doesn’t with me. But I wasn’t there to see it in person, so I can’t tell you her body language or anything (but he’s pretty good with that).  \n  \nThere’s the possibility that she was mad at him, as we recently introduced a new 7-month-old kitten to our household, and after Lily tried attacking her, he showed her that that was bad behavior and put her in a cage. The new kitten is a whole other story, so I won’t really try getting into that unless you guys have more questions.  \n  \nI would say I am the person who spends the most time with her, so I see her behavior throughout the day. She is a sweet cat who, again, likes to hang out with me all day and especially when Im doing something “interesting”. But she does exhibit behaviors of trying to scratch us when things don’t go her way. I would say this, and the fact that she’s so confident and entitled when roaming outside, are our biggest concerns. I love her to the ends of the earth. I would do anything for my cats, but at the same time, I need to assess the situation to ensure everyone (and she) is safe and happy. I would say that if we cannot change her behaviors, we will need to rehome her back to where we got her from, because obviously, her behaviors are problematic. My dad’s biggest concern is her scratching a child's eye out (as my brother is 10 years old), and we often have kids under that age at our house.   \n  \nDo you guys have any suggestions on how to change her behavior? I understand the biggest reason why she thinks it’s okay to act like this is that it’s simply her personality. She’s smart, bold, confident, constantly testing boundaries, and thinks she runs the street. I am wondering if we could do something similar as when she went missing for that week, like scaring her. Im not sure if there is a way to do that, but perhaps with a dog or something of the sort? I did some research and for the scratching at my dad, training her was recommended. But I don’t think that it will help her case, as it’s just her personality, not just simple overstimulation we can all adapt to, as she tries to scratch when things don’t go her way. I wish there were a class (like they have for dogs) that we could pay money for and take her to for them to train her, as my parents want to do that and not give her up.  \n  \nBut yeah, I think I touched on the main parts of the problem overall. We all love her very much, and we want to keep her, but we just don’t want recurring problems and potentially even worse ones. I think the best action would be to rehome her if she can’t change, as I don’t want her to burden my parents anymore. She's so cute, she’s even sleeping by my feet on my bed right now! (She likes to sleep on the floor usually instead) Please let me know if you have any similar experiences with cats regarding her personality or any advice, all would be appreciated. Thank you!  \n  \nPS: im assuming after reading this, some of you may say we are terrible owners for letting/ our cats go outside. I don’t mean to start a debate, but I want to explain it from our side. My parents are really the ones who decided it. They believe keeping a cat indoors their whole life, where they will be “safe,” is also a form of abuse, as cats enjoy being outdoors because it is what they are made for. They say if something happens to them, yes its sad, but its also a part of life, but that at least they lived life to the fullest being able to go outside. Regarding my neighbors, we are trying to resolve that issue especially if it becomes a problem again, but it’s only Lily who is causing trouble. My other cat came from a very secluded farm, so she is extremely timid around new people.  When she goes outside, no one ever sees her, and she has not caused problems as she minds her own business. Overall, we take every precaution possible to ensure they are as safe as possible when going outside. I have to say, though, my cats are extremely happy being able to go outdoors every day :), and I hope this doesn’t make you view us as bad people.",

I know that's unusual.\n\nright now, i'm struggling financially, while my brother somehow figured out how to make money online. I honestly have no idea how he does it. It’s painful seeing him buy things like a new setup, a new iPhone, and other stuff while I have nothing  feeling like a dumb guy who followed the “classic” path of school and college but ended up completely broke.\n\nthe strange thing is: I’ve never asked him for help. We don’t talk because I’ve always assumed he hated me. He criticized me a lot when we were kids, he bullied me, and I also did messed-up things to him, so I always believed he had a reason to hold a grudge. Because of that, I never even tried to start a conversation.\n\nto make it weirder, I think he might be autistic or something, because he barely leaves the house. For the last ten years, he only goes out for basic things, like the supermarket. He has no friends. He just stays in his room all the time.\n\n  \nwhat you guys in my position would do? just try to figure out things alone or ask to help?",

I’m posting here because I could really use some perspective and advice from people who’ve been through tough financial situations.\n\nMy spouse and I recently got caught in a cycle of predatory loans and overdraft fees. Over the last week, we’ve taken real steps to stop the damage — we revoked ACH and debit authorizations, documented everything, and redirected payroll so future income will be protected. That part is finally moving in the right direction.\n\nThe issue now is timing. Payroll changes don’t take effect immediately, so we’re facing a short gap until the end of the month where basics like groceries, gas, and lingering bank fees are hard to cover.\n\nI’m open to any advice, resources, or suggestions from people who’ve navigated something similar. Even hearing what helped you get through a short gap like this would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "text": "[Cross-posted] The instability of being chronically ill has me paralyzed trying to figure out what to do after a car accident and I need some advice My car is my lifeline. I do not live in a city where I could use public transport. My car is almost 17 years old, though, and is kind of falling apart. Before I got sick, I took excellent care of the car. I still take good care of it, but the outsides have started showing more wear and tear than I would like, so I've just focused on maintaining the mechanics of the car. \n\nEarlier this week, a friend of mine backed up into my car. Not a ton of damage, but noticeable. I'm getting a second opinion, but the first place I went to said fixing the cosmetic damage would be thousands of dollars. There is, however, a much cheaper fix that doesn't touch the cosmetic issue but makes sure the bumper is secure and safe. My friend won't be putting this through insurance (she's not sure it will be covered because it was a work car and I wasn't hit during a work event) so is paying in cash. \n\nBecause of my illnesses, I have trouble working and am financially doing very poorly. If this was someone I didn't know, I'd get an estimate, have them pay me, and just get the basic repairs so I can pocket the extra cash. Since I know this person, however, I'm feeling torn about what to do. I do not care about my car's exterior and could really use the money. If I do decide to get the basic fix, I really want to ask my friend to reimburse me for the depreciation of the car. The amount I'm thinking would be less than the cost of a complete fix (and probably about what she would have paid in a deductible), so she saves money given the current circumstances. I could really use the money and I know I'm entitled to it, but I just don't want to spend a stupid amount on fixing the outside of a car that looks like crap. I really need the money now. \n\nThis is stressing me out and it's causing flairs. I've been to my therapist and still just don't know what to do or how to keep the cost down. My car is so freaking important, but finances have been a real stressor lately. I don't want to mess this up.",

Alt account because I'm embarrassed and people I know frequent these.\n\nTLDR: I've been laid off, have little to no savings, own my home and my car, and provide for my partner and our daughter. I need better income, a better job, a better gig, idk but I'm running on fumes.  \n  \n  \nDue to NDA contracts, I cannot use my old employer as a reference or on my resume. My job was dissolved essentially, and ai, and government shutdowns were the two biggest contributors. I was in this position for \\~10 years, and received a small severance, but I'm not complaining as more than half of my team got nothing.\n\nI do not have particularly high demand skills. I started in the realm of design and art direction; however my role changed over time, and I'm a few degrees separated from the design field currently (nor do I have an interest to pursue that field again). I used to shoot photography as a bit of a hobbiest turned pro. I've shot a few weddings, portraits, events, etc—but this was (is) a passion of mine. In a perfect world I'd make my living using cameras, but my focus is less \"perfect world\" and more \"well being,\" and by that I mean, I'd like to make a living where I didn't have to live check to check, worry about my car breaking down or getting a ticket, scouting different groceries and gas stations looking for the cheapest deals, and overall just improve my quality of life, as well as my family's.\n\nSo, what would you genius redditors advise someone do who arguably has nothing? No recent work history, no trade skills, no giant savings or trust fund to tap into, but I have my health, a roof over my head, and I'm not afraid to work.\n\nI tried to present this objectively and without the malice and frustration that runs deep in my heart right now. But, truth be told, at a little at my wits end. I was applying for new jobs for over a year before I was laid off, widening my search with every season of failure. Even now, I can't even get a call back for seasonal retail positions, and life just won't let up. I should also mention that my credit is shot, due to some family issues, and my grad school losing it's accreditation (despite the loans not being forgiven, and I simply cannot afford to make payments on them; this is a long story but they cannot be deferred)\n\nAny help is appreciated. I'm currently debating spending $300 on a program that helps business owners with their finances—in an effort to pour gasoline on my photog side hustle (which has currently become my primary source of income)",

This was presented as an alternative, so I’m trying to think it through carefully.\n\nHere’s the offer:\n\n* $2,000 loan\n* 9-month repayment\n* No minimum credit score requirement\n* 27.5% APR to start\n* $248/month, about $2,232 total if nothing changes\n\nThe part I’m unsure about:  \nThey said the rate isn’t locked and could go down over time if I do a short daily or weekly check-in (about 30 seconds). It’s basically confirming purchases and briefly noting what the spend was for and how I felt about it. They said the rate could drop closer to \\~20% after a month or a few months, depending on consistency, and future loans could start at a lower rate if I repay on time.\n\nI’m curious how others would see this:\n\n* Would you take something like this?\n* If so What's the potential upsdie and downside of this?\n* Is the rate or the check-in requirement the bigger red flag?\n* Does earning a lower rate over time make this better, or just feel gimmicky?\n\nAppreciate any honest reactions.",

Slowly losing my mind here as I try to remain hopeful but feel increasingly squashed under the pressures of the heavy boot that is not doing enough. I could use some advice with me and my girlfriends food situation, there's a disconnect where I feel like I'm doing much better than we apparently are and it's beginning to build resentment. I understand that poverty is inherently difficult but FUCK man I've had it worse before and never been this stressed.  \n\n\nGetting straight to it, I see food to eat and will eat it, feeling better thereafter. My girlfriend is much moreso on the thinner side than me though, and has more of a background in nutritional science so whenever she eats food that would be satisfactory to me she still feels weak, malnourished, and unsatisfied. This is starting to create a huge divide where I will see, for example, potatoes and eggs and eat it for lunch followed by some ramen with eggs for dinner and call it a day but she will still be left struggling.  \n\nI've finally found a job and am awaiting the background check to clear so that we can put this all behind us, but in the meantime, what sorts of food can be eaten to help out? These past few days I've had to increasingly hear about a lack of food, nutrition, and how hungry she is and it's starting to get to me severely, I'm increasingly viewing it as negativity and pessimistic and my reserves of light hearted jovialness are all but dry at this point, I can't keep going like this.  \n\nFor some background, we've got the following ingredients available at our disposal:\n\n- Potatoes , Eggs, Instant Ramen, Strawberries, Mandarins, beans, tortillas, cotija cheese, noodles and sauce, peanut butter and jelly, bacon, chorizo, pancake mix, syrup, and a huge bag of rice.  \n\n\nI've also got a full tub of protein powder I bought from when I had the food/money to lift that she can (offered) use to supplement her nutrition intake.  \n\nI'm planning on going to the food pantry as soon as I can too in order to get some more nutritional foods, should be this Monday but for now only take into consideration the foods listed above.  All of the above food we have in decent quantities aside from bacon.  \n\n\nFor added background we moved in with my parents after a few months of being unable to find work in my home state so my mom will also offer additional cooked food every other day or so, we last had shrimp burritos from them that unfortunately upset my girlfriends stomach.  \n\nSo reddit, any thoughts? What can we do with these foods to help out. I feel like our different backgrounds are clashing here because the food available is not sufficient. She also came from poverty but is predisposed to being more underweight than myself who can pack on weight easy. I'm just as tired of hearing that there's no food as she is of hearing that I lived an entire summer off beans, cheese, and tortillas.",

Context: I’m in a lot of debt (between 3 closed credit cards and a loan on a couch I got 2 years ago, it’s about $17k, and I’m behind on all of my payments) and my rent is $1200. I’m also in the payday loan spiral (Dave, Cleo, etc). I have 2 jobs and make about $4000 a month between them both.\n\nMy car payment was $407 before I started missing payments. I’ve missed so many that it’s $1600 now. I haven’t called Chase about this yet but my credit score is 542 and I don’t qualify for shit anymore. They’ve basically said in an email that I either have to pay my full balance in the next few days or it will be repossessed.\n\nI’m considering just letting them take it honestly. I can’t really afford a car right now, I can take the bus to work (one of my jobs offers a free bus pass). I am aware that they will sell the car and I’ll have to pay the difference, but I’m assuming that will be less than what I’m paying now. It’ll free up some money to start making a dent in my debt. I am also aware that my credit will go down A LOT. But I already don’t qualify for anything anyway and if I start paying back my credit cards, it’ll bounce back (maybe not quickly but it will eventually). I also have student loans to start paying back soon (about $63k)\n\nIs this a bad idea???",

    "text": "In South Korea, 0 income and maxed debt, completely denied welfare/legal aid – how do you survive when every system says no? Location: South Korea (not the US).\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for survival strategies, realistic options, and how to keep going day to day.\n\nHi, I'm a 40s single mom in South Korea, effectively unsupported, with a 12-year-old child who depends on me entirely. I'm in a severe financial and personal crisis and I'm looking for practical survival advice from people who've been through similar situations.\n\nMy situation:\n\nMy younger sibling died by suicide in 2015. Since then I've been trying to \"stay alive\" for my child and my mother. This year, my uncle (who ran a mid-sized company where I worked for 10+ years) died from cancer. After his death, there were family conflicts, inheritance issues, and severe workplace bullying. In June 2024, I was effectively forced out and then officially fired. The company and their labor attorney structured my separation in a way that blocks me from unemployment benefits unless I start a legal fight I cannot afford.\n\nSince then I've had almost no income. My husband has been emotionally and verbally abusive for years and doesn't reliably provide living expenses or child-related costs. I am basically carrying my child and also helping my mother/grandmother with almost no stable support.\n\nI need to be honest about my mental state: As a suicide loss survivor, I'm finding myself having suicidal thoughts again. I keep myself alive thinking of my child and my mother, but I'm genuinely worried I won't be able to hold on much longer if things don't change.\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nI have exhausted almost every official channel:\n\n\\* City and district welfare offices (multiple levels)\n\n\\* National emergency welfare programs\n\n\\* Women's organizations and shelters\n\n\\* Suicide loss survivor services\n\n\\* Legal aid\n\n\\* Filing complaints to higher government bodies\n\n\\* International NGOs\n\nThe answers are always \"you don't meet the criteria,\" \"this is not our responsibility,\" or no reply at all. It feels like I'm stuck in a bureaucratic loop with no exit.\n\nThe immediate crisis:\n\n\\* Credit card companies and collection agencies are calling all day, demanding lump sum payments (around 300k KRW / \\\\\\~220 USD) by specific times, which is impossible.\n\n\\* My phone bill is in arrears and the carrier has already warned that calls will be blocked soon. If that happens, I can't look for work or receive calls from my child's school.\n\n\\* I have other debts to friends/family and school costs I can't cover.\n\nMy credit is already damaged, and it feels like every option is closing.\n\nWhat I'm asking for:\n\nI am NOT asking strangers on the internet to directly pay my bills. I know that's not realistic. I'm looking for practical survival strategies from people who have actually been there.\n\n1. If you were completely shut out of welfare/safety nets (no emergency aid, no unemployment, very low or no income), how did you practically survive the next few months? What actually kept you afloat?\n\n2. What online income options actually work from near-zero starting point, especially for non-native English speakers? I'm not looking for get-rich-quick—just realistic survival income (micro-tasks, digital products, platforms, anything concrete that real people have made money from).\n\n3. For those who went through debt + family abuse + unemployment simultaneously, what did you prioritize first? Legal help? Mental health? Moving out? Physical survival? What stopped you from completely breaking down?\n\nI feel completely isolated. I have no one in my offline life I can talk to honestly about this.\n\nI know nobody here can magically fix my life. But if anyone is willing to share practical, specific things that helped you get through a similar crisis, I would be genuinely grateful. Even a few concrete ideas would give me something to hold onto right now.\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for practical advice and survival strategies only.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "text": "19yo – Just got my first real job in my industry (CNC Machinist) and could use some advice about making more money + investing Hey everyone,\n\nI’m 19M, from an Eastern European country (not a very rich one, but we manage). I’m in my 2nd year of university majoring in Robotics, and this week I officially got my first real job in the industry as a CNC machinist. I’ll be making about 1000€ per month after taxes, which is a huge improvement from what I’ve done before.\n\nFor context:\n\nI’ve worked every summer since I was around 15, but always “non-legal” jobs — basically helping out, getting paid cash, not being a registered employee. This summer I had my first real employment at a small mall island selling phone accessories (putting on screen protectors, helping customers choose cases, etc.). Not the best pay, but it helped.\n\nNow things are getting more serious financially, because of my personal situation.\n\nMy current situation\n\n\t•\tI’ve been with my girlfriend for 3.5 years.\n\n\t•\tWe currently live together at her parents’ place. It’s… not ideal for any of us, but for now it’s what we can afford.\n\n\t•\tWe definitely want to move into our own apartment soon — rent around here for an “OK” place is about 300€/month. With my new CNC job salary we could technically do it.\n\n\t•\tShe’s also in her 2nd year of university, but in the medical field.\n\nAdditional income\n\nBesides work, for the last \\~6 months I’ve been fully supporting both of us financially through a mix of jobs and math tutoring for important high-school exams. I currently earn around 400€/month from tutoring alone.\n\nWhat I need advice on\n\nNow that I’m stepping into a more stable job with better income, I want to be smart about it.\n\n1. How can I increase my income long-term?\n\nI’m willing to learn new skills or get certifications relevant to robotics or machining. Anything useful in Eastern Europe is welcome.\n\n2. What should I consider investing in at my age?\n\nI don’t want to do anything risky like crypto gambling. I just want to start building something for the future, even small.\n\n3. Any advice about budgeting or moving out as a young couple while both in university?\n\nI’m ready to take the responsibility; I just want to make sure I’m not rushing into something that will crush us financially.\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this. Life is starting to feel like it’s moving forward and I want to keep the momentum going. Any honest advice is appreciated. 🙏",

Most people have their own rooms and they're own decent sized home they'll never appreciate what they have which is they're own space. \n\nI'll never forget the day I was finally approved for having my own room after my parents got us approved for a rental. It was after 14+ years of sharing a room with 1-3 other people, being homeless, couch surfing and days away from sleeping in my mom's car during winter. \n\n\nAt first I didn't believe it when we got the acceptance letter. Didn't feel real until we ordered the moving truck and seeing it in the driveway Friday morning. \n\nWhen my room was setup and I laid in my own bed in my own room for the very first time in 15 years, I realized how much I've been missing out on in life and also how people take for granted having their own space. I don't hate privileged people but I think people especially on Reddit should honestly count their blessings",

    "text": "In South Korea, 0 income and maxed debt, completely denied welfare/legal aid – how do you survive when every system says no? Location: South Korea (not the US).\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for survival strategies, realistic options, and how to keep going day to day.\n\nHi, I'm a 40s single mom in South Korea, effectively unsupported, with a 12-year-old child who depends on me entirely. I'm in a severe financial and personal crisis and I'm looking for practical survival advice from people who've been through similar situations.\n\nMy situation:\n\nMy younger sibling died by suicide in 2015. Since then I've been trying to \"stay alive\" for my child and my mother. This year, my uncle (who ran a mid-sized company where I worked for 10+ years) died from cancer. After his death, there were family conflicts, inheritance issues, and severe workplace bullying. In June 2024, I was effectively forced out and then officially fired. The company and their labor attorney structured my separation in a way that blocks me from unemployment benefits unless I start a legal fight I cannot afford.\n\nSince then I've had almost no income. My husband has been emotionally and verbally abusive for years and doesn't reliably provide living expenses or child-related costs. I am basically carrying my child and also helping my mother/grandmother with almost no stable support.\n\nI need to be honest about my mental state: As a suicide loss survivor, I'm finding myself having suicidal thoughts again. I keep myself alive thinking of my child and my mother, but I'm genuinely worried I won't be able to hold on much longer if things don't change.\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nI have exhausted almost every official channel:\n\n\\* City and district welfare offices (multiple levels)\n\n\\* National emergency welfare programs\n\n\\* Women's organizations and shelters\n\n\\* Suicide loss survivor services\n\n\\* Legal aid\n\n\\* Filing complaints to higher government bodies\n\n\\* International NGOs\n\nThe answers are always \"you don't meet the criteria,\" \"this is not our responsibility,\" or no reply at all. It feels like I'm stuck in a bureaucratic loop with no exit.\n\nThe immediate crisis:\n\n\\* Credit card companies and collection agencies are calling all day, demanding lump sum payments (around 300k KRW / \\\\\\~220 USD) by specific times, which is impossible.\n\n\\* My phone bill is in arrears and the carrier has already warned that calls will be blocked soon. If that happens, I can't look for work or receive calls from my child's school.\n\n\\* I have other debts to friends/family and school costs I can't cover.\n\nMy credit is already damaged, and it feels like every option is closing.\n\nWhat I'm asking for:\n\nI am NOT asking strangers on the internet to directly pay my bills. I know that's not realistic. I'm looking for practical survival strategies from people who have actually been there.\n\n1. If you were completely shut out of welfare/safety nets (no emergency aid, no unemployment, very low or no income), how did you practically survive the next few months? What actually kept you afloat?\n\n2. What online income options actually work from near-zero starting point, especially for non-native English speakers? I'm not looking for get-rich-quick—just realistic survival income (micro-tasks, digital products, platforms, anything concrete that real people have made money from).\n\n3. For those who went through debt + family abuse + unemployment simultaneously, what did you prioritize first? Legal help? Mental health? Moving out? Physical survival? What stopped you from completely breaking down?\n\nI feel completely isolated. I have no one in my offline life I can talk to honestly about this.\n\nI know nobody here can magically fix my life. But if anyone is willing to share practical, specific things that helped you get through a similar crisis, I would be genuinely grateful. Even a few concrete ideas would give me something to hold onto right now.\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for practical advice and survival strategies only.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Wells fargo kept hitting me with overdraft fees\"\n\n\"You know you can turn that off right? You'll have to call customer service.\n\n\"Won't that be a pain in the ass?\"\n\n\"It's probably worth saving 300+ dollars dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess you're right about that\".\n\n\"What about your phone bill. It's $80 a month. Are you on a contract?\n\n\"No it's month to month. I have just always had version\"\n\n\"You spend 90% of your time at home or work with Wi-Fi. Why don't you switch to a mvno? It won't be as good, but you will almost never use it anyways. You'll save like $700.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that was an option \"\n\n\"What about your CBD use?\"\n\n\"I can't cut back on that. I use it to self-medicate my OCD.\"\n\n\"Okay, you know your body. But why do you only buy it from the corner store? Why not online\"\n\n\"Because it's the same price!\"\n\n\"Yeah for a single week. Check the bulk pricing.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's like 40% off if I buy at least a month supply. If I buy three months, it's free shipping\"\n\n\"Okay, that's like another few hundred\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe managed to \"find\" another $2000 in savings for this year. \n\nMy GF is an intelligent person.

You can Google how to save money.\"\n\n\"I'm bad at math\"\n\n\\-\"You have a claculator on your phone. It's not even complex math.\"\n\n\"I get decision fatigue\"\n\n\"That $2000 just saved you a 100+ hours of working. I think it would be worth pushing past the fatigue. \"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nShe's not the first person I've run into with the same handful of excuses. I don't think any of them are the real reason.\n\nI'm leaning towards it being anxiety and avoidance.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?",

Alt account because I'm embarrassed and people I know frequent these.\n\nTLDR: I've been laid off, have little to no savings, own my home and my car, and provide for my partner and our daughter. I need better income, a better job, a better gig, idk but I'm running on fumes.  \n  \n  \nDue to NDA contracts, I cannot use my old employer as a reference or on my resume. My job was dissolved essentially, and ai, and government shutdowns were the two biggest contributors. I was in this position for \\~10 years, and received a small severance, but I'm not complaining as more than half of my team got nothing.\n\nI do not have particularly high demand skills. I started in the realm of design and art direction; however my role changed over time, and I'm a few degrees separated from the design field currently (nor do I have an interest to pursue that field again). I used to shoot photography as a bit of a hobbiest turned pro. I've shot a few weddings, portraits, events, etc—but this was (is) a passion of mine. In a perfect world I'd make my living using cameras, but my focus is less \"perfect world\" and more \"well being,\" and by that I mean, I'd like to make a living where I didn't have to live check to check, worry about my car breaking down or getting a ticket, scouting different groceries and gas stations looking for the cheapest deals, and overall just improve my quality of life, as well as my family's.\n\nSo, what would you genius redditors advise someone do who arguably has nothing? No recent work history, no trade skills, no giant savings or trust fund to tap into, but I have my health, a roof over my head, and I'm not afraid to work.\n\nI tried to present this objectively and without the malice and frustration that runs deep in my heart right now. But, truth be told, at a little at my wits end. I was applying for new jobs for over a year before I was laid off, widening my search with every season of failure. Even now, I can't even get a call back for seasonal retail positions, and life just won't let up. I should also mention that my credit is shot, due to some family issues, and my grad school losing it's accreditation (despite the loans not being forgiven, and I simply cannot afford to make payments on them; this is a long story but they cannot be deferred)\n\nAny help is appreciated. I'm currently debating spending $300 on a program that helps business owners with their finances—in an effort to pour gasoline on my photog side hustle (which has currently become my primary source of income)",

It’s… not ideal for any of us, but for now it’s what we can afford.\n\n\t•\tWe definitely want to move into our own apartment soon — rent around here for an “OK” place is about 300€/month. With my new CNC job salary we could technically do it.\n\n\t•\tShe’s also in her 2nd year of university, but in the medical field.\n\nAdditional income\n\nBesides work, for the last \\~6 months I’ve been fully supporting both of us financially through a mix of jobs and math tutoring for important high-school exams. I currently earn around 400€/month from tutoring alone.\n\nWhat I need advice on\n\nNow that I’m stepping into a more stable job with better income, I want to be smart about it.\n\n1. How can I increase my income long-term?\n\nI’m willing to learn new skills or get certifications relevant to robotics or machining. Anything useful in Eastern Europe is welcome.\n\n2. What should I consider investing in at my age?\n\nI don’t want to do anything risky like crypto gambling. I just want to start building something for the future, even small.\n\n3. Any advice about budgeting or moving out as a young couple while both in university?\n\nI’m ready to take the responsibility; I just want to make sure I’m not rushing into something that will crush us financially.\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this. Life is starting to feel like it’s moving forward and I want to keep the momentum going. Any honest advice is appreciated. 🙏",

I've already decided to use the money I recieve towards the end of the month to pay my rent, $350, our cable bill $40, and pay off whatever I can on my credit card. \nI want to start saving money because I understand how privileged I am right now, I attend college with no student loans and I do recieve a good amount back for financial aid. \nI live with my aunt and thats why my portion of rent has been so cheap, she doesn't worry about paying for other utilities. She gets her check and most of it goes towards our rent, but she's also a chronic smoker... she has no money for herself and can't buy herself cigarettes most of the time. I want to be able to help her, take her out, pay for things around the apartment, but I also know I wont have her forever and need money to fall back on and I've never really had freedom before or my own  money due to growing up in foster care so I'd like to be able to spend money on myself aswell..\nI dont want to give a sob story about my situation but will answer questions that'll give more context. \ni honestly just think my biggest issue is not being able to say no",

    "text": "Voluntary repossession? Context: I’m in a lot of debt (between 3 closed credit cards and a loan on a couch I got 2 years ago, it’s about $17k, and I’m behind on all of my payments) and my rent is $1200. I’m also in the payday loan spiral (Dave, Cleo, etc). I have 2 jobs and make about $4000 a month between them both.\n\nMy car payment was $407 before I started missing payments. I’ve missed so many that it’s $1600 now. I haven’t called Chase about this yet but my credit score is 542 and I don’t qualify for shit anymore. They’ve basically said in an email that I either have to pay my full balance in the next few days or it will be repossessed.\n\nI’m considering just letting them take it honestly. I can’t really afford a car right now, I can take the bus to work (one of my jobs offers a free bus pass). I am aware that they will sell the car and I’ll have to pay the difference, but I’m assuming that will be less than what I’m paying now. It’ll free up some money to start making a dent in my debt. I am also aware that my credit will go down A LOT. But I already don’t qualify for anything anyway and if I start paying back my credit cards, it’ll bounce back (maybe not quickly but it will eventually). I also have student loans to start paying back soon (about $63k)\n\nIs this a bad idea???",

However, my credit is trash and I don't seem to be able to pre-qualify for any loan that's not outright predatory with APR at 20-30%.

In spite of how tiring it is, this is fast becoming my new normal. \n\nAm I crazy to just... keep commuting by bus until I figure things out? The only thing that I'm really afraid of is that work is aware of my car situation because it's a very chatty, gossipy office and I don't want to get fired for not having reliable transportation. Technically it's illegal to do that but I'm still worried. I just got a bonus this week so I think I'm a valuable employee but I'm consumed with worry about this currently.

    "text": "[Cross-posted] The instability of being chronically ill has me paralyzed trying to figure out what to do after a car accident and I need some advice My car is my lifeline. I do not live in a city where I could use public transport. My car is almost 17 years old, though, and is kind of falling apart. Before I got sick, I took excellent care of the car. I still take good care of it, but the outsides have started showing more wear and tear than I would like, so I've just focused on maintaining the mechanics of the car. \n\nEarlier this week, a friend of mine backed up into my car. Not a ton of damage, but noticeable. I'm getting a second opinion, but the first place I went to said fixing the cosmetic damage would be thousands of dollars. There is, however, a much cheaper fix that doesn't touch the cosmetic issue but makes sure the bumper is secure and safe. My friend won't be putting this through insurance (she's not sure it will be covered because it was a work car and I wasn't hit during a work event) so is paying in cash. \n\nBecause of my illnesses, I have trouble working and am financially doing very poorly. If this was someone I didn't know, I'd get an estimate, have them pay me, and just get the basic repairs so I can pocket the extra cash. Since I know this person, however, I'm feeling torn about what to do. I do not care about my car's exterior and could really use the money. If I do decide to get the basic fix, I really want to ask my friend to reimburse me for the depreciation of the car. The amount I'm thinking would be less than the cost of a complete fix (and probably about what she would have paid in a deductible), so she saves money given the current circumstances. I could really use the money and I know I'm entitled to it, but I just don't want to spend a stupid amount on fixing the outside of a car that looks like crap. I really need the money now. \n\nThis is stressing me out and it's causing flairs. I've been to my therapist and still just don't know what to do or how to keep the cost down. My car is so freaking important, but finances have been a real stressor lately. I don't want to mess this up.",

Because of that, I never even tried to start a conversation.\n\nto make it weirder, I think he might be autistic or something, because he barely leaves the house. For the last ten years, he only goes out for basic things, like the supermarket. He has no friends.

Two years ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines: [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\\_enforcement\\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)\n\n\n\nAfter a 6 month evaluation period, the determination was that these changes needed to become permanent.  \n\n\n\nSo here is how it is going to be. Any infraction can **will** incur a temp ban. This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable. Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.\n\nA second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction. Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.\n\nParticularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate. We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.\n\nOvertly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning or explanation.\n\n\n\nAs always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair. HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well. If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it. If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended. If you come into modmail asking \"why was I banned\" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension. And please note that saying \"Other kids were doing it too mom\" is not a valid appeal. If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.\n\nThese mod actions are statutory, and are our SOP.  It's never personal.  We don't play favorites.  We take action on plenty of invalid items we totally agree with, and we take the exact same actions on stuff we vehemently disagree with.  \n\nWe are a small team. We can't see everything posted here. But we sure as hell see all the reports.\n\n\n\n**Note:** Intent matters. Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.\n\n**Note 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people. We **won't** be able to prevent shitty people wandering in. We **can** see them to the door as quickly as they arrive. **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.** We are a 4 man mod team working in a 2.4 million subscriber subreddit, so we depend on the community to flag offenses for us to take action on.  If you see something bad, **REPORT IT!!**  We probably won't see it otherwise.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on. Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process!",

Didn't feel real until we ordered the moving truck and seeing it in the driveway Friday morning. \n\nWhen my room was setup and I laid in my own bed in my own room for the very first time in 15 years, I realized how much I've been missing out on in life and also how people take for granted having their own space. I don't hate privileged people but I think people especially on Reddit should honestly count their blessings",

    "text": "In South Korea, 0 income and maxed debt, completely denied welfare/legal aid – how do you survive when every system says no? Location: South Korea (not the US).\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for survival strategies, realistic options, and how to keep going day to day.\n\nHi, I'm a 40s single mom in South Korea, effectively unsupported, with a 12-year-old child who depends on me entirely. I'm in a severe financial and personal crisis and I'm looking for practical survival advice from people who've been through similar situations.\n\nMy situation:\n\nMy younger sibling died by suicide in 2015. Since then I've been trying to \"stay alive\" for my child and my mother. This year, my uncle (who ran a mid-sized company where I worked for 10+ years) died from cancer. After his death, there were family conflicts, inheritance issues, and severe workplace bullying. In June 2024, I was effectively forced out and then officially fired. The company and their labor attorney structured my separation in a way that blocks me from unemployment benefits unless I start a legal fight I cannot afford.\n\nSince then I've had almost no income. My husband has been emotionally and verbally abusive for years and doesn't reliably provide living expenses or child-related costs. I am basically carrying my child and also helping my mother/grandmother with almost no stable support.\n\nI need to be honest about my mental state: As a suicide loss survivor, I'm finding myself having suicidal thoughts again. I keep myself alive thinking of my child and my mother, but I'm genuinely worried I won't be able to hold on much longer if things don't change.\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nI have exhausted almost every official channel:\n\n\\* City and district welfare offices (multiple levels)\n\n\\* National emergency welfare programs\n\n\\* Women's organizations and shelters\n\n\\* Suicide loss survivor services\n\n\\* Legal aid\n\n\\* Filing complaints to higher government bodies\n\n\\* International NGOs\n\nThe answers are always \"you don't meet the criteria,\" \"this is not our responsibility,\" or no reply at all. It feels like I'm stuck in a bureaucratic loop with no exit.\n\nThe immediate crisis:\n\n\\* Credit card companies and collection agencies are calling all day, demanding lump sum payments (around 300k KRW / \\\\\\~220 USD) by specific times, which is impossible.\n\n\\* My phone bill is in arrears and the carrier has already warned that calls will be blocked soon. If that happens, I can't look for work or receive calls from my child's school.\n\n\\* I have other debts to friends/family and school costs I can't cover.\n\nMy credit is already damaged, and it feels like every option is closing.\n\nWhat I'm asking for:\n\nI am NOT asking strangers on the internet to directly pay my bills. I know that's not realistic. I'm looking for practical survival strategies from people who have actually been there.\n\n1. If you were completely shut out of welfare/safety nets (no emergency aid, no unemployment, very low or no income), how did you practically survive the next few months? What actually kept you afloat?\n\n2. What online income options actually work from near-zero starting point, especially for non-native English speakers? I'm not looking for get-rich-quick—just realistic survival income (micro-tasks, digital products, platforms, anything concrete that real people have made money from).\n\n3. For those who went through debt + family abuse + unemployment simultaneously, what did you prioritize first? Legal help? Mental health? Moving out? Physical survival? What stopped you from completely breaking down?\n\nI feel completely isolated. I have no one in my offline life I can talk to honestly about this.\n\nI know nobody here can magically fix my life. But if anyone is willing to share practical, specific things that helped you get through a similar crisis, I would be genuinely grateful. Even a few concrete ideas would give me something to hold onto right now.\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for practical advice and survival strategies only.\n\nThank you for reading.",

This was presented as an alternative, so I’m trying to think it through carefully.\n\nHere’s the offer:\n\n* $2,000 loan\n* 9-month repayment\n* No minimum credit score requirement\n* 27.5% APR to start\n* $248/month, about $2,232 total if nothing changes\n\nThe part I’m unsure about:  \nThey said the rate isn’t locked and could go down over time if I do a short daily or weekly check-in (about 30 seconds). It’s basically confirming purchases and briefly noting what the spend was for and how I felt about it. They said the rate could drop closer to \\~20% after a month or a few months, depending on consistency, and future loans could start at a lower rate if I repay on time.\n\nI’m curious how others would see this:\n\n* Would you take something like this?\n* If so What's the potential upsdie and downside of this?\n* Is the rate or the check-in requirement the bigger red flag?\n* Does earning a lower rate over time make this better, or just feel gimmicky?\n\nAppreciate any honest reactions.",

    "text": "Voluntary repossession? Context: I’m in a lot of debt (between 3 closed credit cards and a loan on a couch I got 2 years ago, it’s about $17k, and I’m behind on all of my payments) and my rent is $1200. I’m also in the payday loan spiral (Dave, Cleo, etc). I have 2 jobs and make about $4000 a month between them both.\n\nMy car payment was $407 before I started missing payments. I’ve missed so many that it’s $1600 now. I haven’t called Chase about this yet but my credit score is 542 and I don’t qualify for shit anymore. They’ve basically said in an email that I either have to pay my full balance in the next few days or it will be repossessed.\n\nI’m considering just letting them take it honestly. I can’t really afford a car right now, I can take the bus to work (one of my jobs offers a free bus pass). I am aware that they will sell the car and I’ll have to pay the difference, but I’m assuming that will be less than what I’m paying now. It’ll free up some money to start making a dent in my debt. I am also aware that my credit will go down A LOT. But I already don’t qualify for anything anyway and if I start paying back my credit cards, it’ll bounce back (maybe not quickly but it will eventually). I also have student loans to start paying back soon (about $63k)\n\nIs this a bad idea???",

It completely busted my headlight case, put a crack in my fender, and paint all over the front of my car. Now my insurance is gonna go up, and it’s already expensive as hell. Plus, I don’t know if they will accept my claim.\n\nI got a threatening letter from the IRS saying they will levy my bank account. I owe them $437, you would think it’s 1 million by the way they’re coming after me. There’s no option to make a payment plan through the portal. Now I’m gonna have to call and be on hold for hours to even talk to anybody about it.\n\nI’ve been trying for 15 months to get this unclaimed money from my father. He passed away 21 years ago. The company I was working with apparently didn’t know what they were doing at first, I finally got someone who knew what they were doing. Now they’re going to cancel our agreement. There’s some legal issues there, it has to be opened back up through probate. The money is just sitting there, but I can’t just claim it even though I should be able to. That was about $8000. That would’ve really helped me.\n\nI just feel completely overwhelmed. I’ve been doing DoorDash Uber for a long time just to survive. I can’t seem to find a job that pays what I need to make to even live. I’m killing my car, I’m hanging on by a thread and can barely pay bills. I still owe on my car payment from last month, plus car insurance for this month. I can’t get caught up, I can’t fix anything that’s wrong with my car because I don’t have the money. I can’t get any help. I’m basically stuck in Groundhog Day for the rest of my life. It feels like. The only reason I’m not homeless, is because my roommate is pretty understanding and nice. I don’t even wanna try anymore.",

    "text": "Losing my mind with our current food situation, anyone else? What helps out? Slowly losing my mind here as I try to remain hopeful but feel increasingly squashed under the pressures of the heavy boot that is not doing enough. I could use some advice with me and my girlfriends food situation, there's a disconnect where I feel like I'm doing much better than we apparently are and it's beginning to build resentment. I understand that poverty is inherently difficult but FUCK man I've had it worse before and never been this stressed.  \n\n\nGetting straight to it, I see food to eat and will eat it, feeling better thereafter. My girlfriend is much moreso on the thinner side than me though, and has more of a background in nutritional science so whenever she eats food that would be satisfactory to me she still feels weak, malnourished, and unsatisfied. This is starting to create a huge divide where I will see, for example, potatoes and eggs and eat it for lunch followed by some ramen with eggs for dinner and call it a day but she will still be left struggling.  \n\nI've finally found a job and am awaiting the background check to clear so that we can put this all behind us, but in the meantime, what sorts of food can be eaten to help out? These past few days I've had to increasingly hear about a lack of food, nutrition, and how hungry she is and it's starting to get to me severely, I'm increasingly viewing it as negativity and pessimistic and my reserves of light hearted jovialness are all but dry at this point, I can't keep going like this.  \n\nFor some background, we've got the following ingredients available at our disposal:\n\n- Potatoes , Eggs, Instant Ramen, Strawberries, Mandarins, beans, tortillas, cotija cheese, noodles and sauce, peanut butter and jelly, bacon, chorizo, pancake mix, syrup, and a huge bag of rice.  \n\n\nI've also got a full tub of protein powder I bought from when I had the food/money to lift that she can (offered) use to supplement her nutrition intake.  \n\nI'm planning on going to the food pantry as soon as I can too in order to get some more nutritional foods, should be this Monday but for now only take into consideration the foods listed above.  All of the above food we have in decent quantities aside from bacon.  \n\n\nFor added background we moved in with my parents after a few months of being unable to find work in my home state so my mom will also offer additional cooked food every other day or so, we last had shrimp burritos from them that unfortunately upset my girlfriends stomach.  \n\nSo reddit, any thoughts? What can we do with these foods to help out. I feel like our different backgrounds are clashing here because the food available is not sufficient. She also came from poverty but is predisposed to being more underweight than myself who can pack on weight easy. I'm just as tired of hearing that there's no food as she is of hearing that I lived an entire summer off beans, cheese, and tortillas.",

    "text": "Temporary financial gap after stopping predatory loans — looking for advice or support Hey everyone. I’m posting here because I could really use some perspective and advice from people who’ve been through tough financial situations.\n\nMy spouse and I recently got caught in a cycle of predatory loans and overdraft fees. Over the last week, we’ve taken real steps to stop the damage — we revoked ACH and debit authorizations, documented everything, and redirected payroll so future income will be protected. That part is finally moving in the right direction.\n\nThe issue now is timing. Payroll changes don’t take effect immediately, so we’re facing a short gap until the end of the month where basics like groceries, gas, and lingering bank fees are hard to cover.\n\nI’m open to any advice, resources, or suggestions from people who’ve navigated something similar. Even hearing what helped you get through a short gap like this would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "text": "How to best heat an apartment that won't skyrocket my electric bill? The heat in my apartment (actually, the whole unit so all 4 apartments!) went out last night. 🫠 It was 48 degrees in my apartment when I left for work this morning and landlord's response is \"we'll have someone out in 48-72 hours but it might not be until Monday\". this shit sucks. I hate living under a slumlord but I also can't afford anywhere else because I'm priced out of better apartments. The apartment is 792 square feet, 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment. My upstairs neighbor was absolutely losing her mind this morning on the phone with our landlord (or his wife, maybe since I know they handle things together) when I left to drop my daughter off at school and head to work. \n\nI know the usual bundle up, wear layers, etc. I have one small space heater that I can put in my daughter's room, but since I'm sleeping on an air mattress in what is essentially the living/dining room, and our floor is hard concrete with linoleum/tile on top, the floor gets COLD. I was grateful/thankful enough to get caught up on past due rent, the late fee my landlord charges, and paid off my electric bill for December thanks to charity but I am counting pennies, essentially, until payday next week. Thanks to local charities and churches, my bills are okay but it's not like I have extra money to throw around to buy more than 1 more space heater or maybe a small heated blanket for my kid. Since I just managed to get my electric bill paid off, I know running a space heater can jack up my bill. I usually keep my heat between 64-66 but waking up to absolutely NO heat was a surprise this morning.\n\nNot sure if there is much other advice other than wear socks (or double up on socks) so the floor isn't freezing our feet, run the small space heater in the living room until my daughter goes to bed? Wear layers and stay under our blankets unless it's absolutely necessary. I have an appointment to donate plasma again on Saturday. This isn't something I can outsource (I don't even know what's wrong nor do I have the funds to pay a diagnostic fee plus pay for whatever the issue is. It's not like my landlord will reimburse me or take it off my rent lol) \n\nI've lived in this apartment for 4 years now and we've never had issues with our heat. Yeah I've dealt with bugs, air conditioning going out in the summer, mold in the bathroom, hot water heater tank going out (that sucked because it happened over a weekend) but at least the heat was always consistent. I am not looking forward to going home to my ice box of an apartment later this afternoon lol",

    "text": "My Dad doesn't understand how poor I am. I work a full time job. I make an ok salary (at least on paper). But I'm living paycheck to paycheck. Every month I try to save, and then something happens that eats up all of that and often plus some. \n\nRecently I've been dealing to incessant back and leg pain. Not the worst pain in the world, but constantly there. I'm pretty confident it is nerve pain of some sort and my doctor agrees. He ordered a MRI and a nerve conduction test to see if we can figure out what is causing it so we can fix it or at least mitigate it. I was informed by the hospital today that my insurance has denied the claim for the MRI. That it will cost $3471.00 if I do it out of pocket. I need to get in contact with my doctor so that he can appeal the denial. \n\nThe point being I told all of this to my Dad, because he recently asked to be kept more up to date with things, and he is worried about the long term issues that could come with the nerve pain if it isn't treated. I did not ask for money, I was just keeping him informed. He asked lots of questions, and I answered to the best of my ability with the information that I have right now. \n\nThen he asked what I was going to do if the denial is upheld. And I told him that if that was the case I'd have to just not get the MRI. That one MRI would cost almost a month's take home pay for me. It just isn't possible for me to do right now. \n\nHe got angry. \"What do you mean you just wouldn't get the MRI?! What would be the path forward for your pain?\" I answered, honestly that there wouldn't be a path forward to fix the pain in that case unless my insurance approves some other test. He simply could not fathom that I would \"give up\" on getting rid of the pain that is making every day worse and only seems to be getting worse with time. \n\nI don't have a choice if the claim isn't accepted. That's my reality. I would have to choose between the MRI and housing or food. And two out of those three things aren't really optional. No one said I was guaranteed a pain free life. But I do have to eat. And having shelter is pretty essential to continuing to be able to do my job and survive. It isn't a want. It isn't I'm not trying hard enough. I just can't. \n\nI don't know if there really is any advice to give other than to keep fighting my insurance and not give up hope. \n\nEdit to add: I absolutely own that part of what I'm dealing with is my own fault. I know that I'm not always making the best decisions with my money. I know that I made bad decisions in the past which I am still paying for and will be for years to come. Those are just realities that I have to live with for now. That doesn't change that right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck. That said, I am making concentrated efforts to do better in the future. The things that keep coming up have mostly been medical this year. My mental and physical health have just been... Bad. We've been trying to find solutions and just have struck out over and over again. It's endlessly frustrating that I'm in this cycle of needing to pay for health care to be able to continue doing the things that I need and want to do, but not being able to afford it and so my health gets worse. \n\nI also agree that my outlook is pessimistic. I have been diagnosed with MDD, PDD, and GAD in the last 5 years though I've been dealing with them my whole life. I don't have a positive outlook on this because so far my experiences have just been bad. I keep pushing forward because I know that part of what I'm feeling at least is my brain lying to me. And I have to have some hope that eventually we will figure things out and I can at least be in less pain than I am now or I would just give up entirely on life. Even knowing what is happening but not being able to do anything about it would be preferable to right now. Because if I know what is going on I can say, ok this isn't ever going to get better but I can figure out things to make the day to day not as bad. Without knowing what is wrong I just have to guess and check. And that hasn't had a strong track record recently.",

    "text": "Getting evicted almost every month. Need guidance. Every month for the past year I have to pull money from my 401K (don't really know why I have it, it was a requirement when I got hired at my current company) to pay rent. By the time I am able to get rent paid with the hardship money there are so many late fees and penalties stacked on to my past due rent that it is impossible to get caught up to where I can pay on time the next month. \n\nGetting evicted almost every month has caused me much stress and is making me physically sick. I have started having panic attacks and sleeping problems and can barely function. I have withdrawn myself from society and self-isolate a lot. It makes me feel like a bad person or a moral failure because I can't pay my bills on time and am failing adulthood at 32 years of age. \n\nAnyways, I am just wondering what would you do if you were in my situation? There are no affordable apartments within my price range ($800 and under) in my area (Arlington, Texas) and the ones that are affordable are in horrible parts of Fort Worth with 1-star reviews that speak of rodent infestations and crime.\n\nIt costs more money to move out of my current apartment and my lease is ending in April. I have a feeling my apartment manager is going to try to raise the rent to where I really have no choice but to move because I know she is tired of dealing with me being late every month. I can't blame her. \n\nI have thought about looking for a room to rent on [Roomies.com](http://Roomies.com) but as a single female I feel so uncomfortable and nervous about moving in with a complete stranger. Not to mention most of the people on there offering a room are older males. I also have a cat and not many people are OK with pets. \n\nI don't have any family I can move back home with. So that isn't an option. \n\nWhat should I do?",

Slowly losing my mind here as I try to remain hopeful but feel increasingly squashed under the pressures of the heavy boot that is not doing enough. I could use some advice with me and my girlfriends food situation, there's a disconnect where I feel like I'm doing much better than we apparently are and it's beginning to build resentment. I understand that poverty is inherently difficult but FUCK man I've had it worse before and never been this stressed.  \n\n\nGetting straight to it, I see food to eat and will eat it, feeling better thereafter. My girlfriend is much moreso on the thinner side than me though, and has more of a background in nutritional science so whenever she eats food that would be satisfactory to me she still feels weak, malnourished, and unsatisfied. This is starting to create a huge divide where I will see, for example, potatoes and eggs and eat it for lunch followed by some ramen with eggs for dinner and call it a day but she will still be left struggling.  \n\nI've finally found a job and am awaiting the background check to clear so that we can put this all behind us, but in the meantime, what sorts of food can be eaten to help out? These past few days I've had to increasingly hear about a lack of food, nutrition, and how hungry she is and it's starting to get to me severely, I'm increasingly viewing it as negativity and pessimistic and my reserves of light hearted jovialness are all but dry at this point, I can't keep going like this.  \n\nFor some background, we've got the following ingredients available at our disposal:\n\n- Potatoes , Eggs, Instant Ramen, Strawberries, Mandarins, beans, tortillas, cotija cheese, noodles and sauce, peanut butter and jelly, bacon, chorizo, pancake mix, syrup, and a huge bag of rice.  \n\n\nI've also got a full tub of protein powder I bought from when I had the food/money to lift that she can (offered) use to supplement her nutrition intake.  \n\nI'm planning on going to the food pantry as soon as I can too in order to get some more nutritional foods, should be this Monday but for now only take into consideration the foods listed above.  All of the above food we have in decent quantities aside from bacon.  \n\n\nFor added background we moved in with my parents after a few months of being unable to find work in my home state so my mom will also offer additional cooked food every other day or so, we last had shrimp burritos from them that unfortunately upset my girlfriends stomach.  \n\nSo reddit, any thoughts? What can we do with these foods to help out. I feel like our different backgrounds are clashing here because the food available is not sufficient. She also came from poverty but is predisposed to being more underweight than myself who can pack on weight easy. I'm just as tired of hearing that there's no food as she is of hearing that I lived an entire summer off beans, cheese, and tortillas.",

I’m posting here because I could really use some perspective and advice from people who’ve been through tough financial situations.\n\nMy spouse and I recently got caught in a cycle of predatory loans and overdraft fees. Over the last week, we’ve taken real steps to stop the damage — we revoked ACH and debit authorizations, documented everything, and redirected payroll so future income will be protected. That part is finally moving in the right direction.\n\nThe issue now is timing. Payroll changes don’t take effect immediately, so we’re facing a short gap until the end of the month where basics like groceries, gas, and lingering bank fees are hard to cover.\n\nI’m open to any advice, resources, or suggestions from people who’ve navigated something similar.

This was presented as an alternative, so I’m trying to think it through carefully.\n\nHere’s the offer:\n\n* $2,000 loan\n* 9-month repayment\n* No minimum credit score requirement\n* 27.5% APR to start\n* $248/month, about $2,232 total if nothing changes\n\nThe part I’m unsure about:  \nThey said the rate isn’t locked and could go down over time if I do a short daily or weekly check-in (about 30 seconds). It’s basically confirming purchases and briefly noting what the spend was for and how I felt about it. They said the rate could drop closer to \\~20% after a month or a few months, depending on consistency, and future loans could start at a lower rate if I repay on time.\n\nI’m curious how others would see this:\n\n* Would you take something like this?\n* If so What's the potential upsdie and downside of this?\n* Is the rate or the check-in requirement the bigger red flag?\n* Does earning a lower rate over time make this better, or just feel gimmicky?\n\nAppreciate any honest reactions.",

I’m also in the payday loan spiral (Dave, Cleo, etc). I have 2 jobs and make about $4000 a month between them both.\n\nMy car payment was $407 before I started missing payments. I’ve missed so many that it’s $1600 now. I haven’t called Chase about this yet but my credit score is 542 and I don’t qualify for shit anymore. They’ve basically said in an email that I either have to pay my full balance in the next few days or it will be repossessed.\n\nI’m considering just letting them take it honestly. I can’t really afford a car right now, I can take the bus to work (one of my jobs offers a free bus pass). I am aware that they will sell the car and I’ll have to pay the difference, but I’m assuming that will be less than what I’m paying now. It’ll free up some money to start making a dent in my debt. I am also aware that my credit will go down A LOT.

He criticized me a lot when we were kids, he bullied me, and I also did messed-up things to him, so I always believed he had a reason to hold a grudge. Because of that, I never even tried to start a conversation.\n\nto make it weirder, I think he might be autistic or something, because he barely leaves the house. For the last ten years, he only goes out for basic things, like the supermarket. He has no friends. He just stays in his room all the time.\n\n  \nwhat you guys in my position would do? just try to figure out things alone or ask to help?",

However, my credit is trash and I don't seem to be able to pre-qualify for any loan that's not outright predatory with APR at 20-30%. I am currently commuting 3-4 hours round trip by bus every day to get to work. In spite of how tiring it is, this is fast becoming my new normal. \n\nAm I crazy to just... keep commuting by bus until I figure things out? The only thing that I'm really afraid of is that work is aware of my car situation because it's a very chatty, gossipy office and I don't want to get fired for not having reliable transportation. Technically it's illegal to do that but I'm still worried. I just got a bonus this week so I think I'm a valuable employee but I'm consumed with worry about this currently. Please, any advice or input you have may be helpful. \n\nS",

The company and their labor attorney structured my separation in a way that blocks me from unemployment benefits unless I start a legal fight I cannot afford.\n\nSince then I've had almost no income. My husband has been emotionally and verbally abusive for years and doesn't reliably provide living expenses or child-related costs. I am basically carrying my child and also helping my mother/grandmother with almost no stable support.\n\nI need to be honest about my mental state: As a suicide loss survivor, I'm finding myself having suicidal thoughts again. I keep myself alive thinking of my child and my mother, but I'm genuinely worried I won't be able to hold on much longer if things don't change.\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nI have exhausted almost every official channel:\n\n\\* City and district welfare offices (multiple levels)\n\n\\* National emergency welfare programs\n\n\\* Women's organizations and shelters\n\n\\* Suicide loss survivor services\n\n\\* Legal aid\n\n\\* Filing complaints to higher government bodies\n\n\\* International NGOs\n\nThe answers are always \"you don't meet the criteria,\" \"this is not our responsibility,\" or no reply at all. It feels like I'm stuck in a bureaucratic loop with no exit.\n\nThe immediate crisis:\n\n\\* Credit card companies and collection agencies are calling all day, demanding lump sum payments (around 300k KRW / \\\\\\~220 USD) by specific times, which is impossible.\n\n\\* My phone bill is in arrears and the carrier has already warned that calls will be blocked soon. If that happens, I can't look for work or receive calls from my child's school.\n\n\\* I have other debts to friends/family and school costs I can't cover.\n\nMy credit is already damaged, and it feels like every option is closing.\n\nWhat I'm asking for:\n\nI am NOT asking strangers on the internet to directly pay my bills. I know that's not realistic. I'm looking for practical survival strategies from people who have actually been there.\n\n1. If you were completely shut out of welfare/safety nets (no emergency aid, no unemployment, very low or no income), how did you practically survive the next few months? What actually kept you afloat?\n\n2. What online income options actually work from near-zero starting point, especially for non-native English speakers? I'm not looking for get-rich-quick—just realistic survival income (micro-tasks, digital products, platforms, anything concrete that real people have made money from).\n\n3. For those who went through debt + family abuse + unemployment simultaneously, what did you prioritize first? Legal help? Mental health? Moving out? Physical survival? What stopped you from completely breaking down?\n\nI feel completely isolated. I have no one in my offline life I can talk to honestly about this.\n\nI know nobody here can magically fix my life. But if anyone is willing to share practical, specific things that helped you get through a similar crisis, I would be genuinely grateful. Even a few concrete ideas would give me something to hold onto right now.\n\nI’m not asking for money or donations. I’m asking for practical advice and survival strategies only.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "text": "19yo – Just got my first real job in my industry (CNC Machinist) and could use some advice about making more money + investing Hey everyone,\n\nI’m 19M, from an Eastern European country (not a very rich one, but we manage). I’m in my 2nd year of university majoring in Robotics, and this week I officially got my first real job in the industry as a CNC machinist. I’ll be making about 1000€ per month after taxes, which is a huge improvement from what I’ve done before.\n\nFor context:\n\nI’ve worked every summer since I was around 15, but always “non-legal” jobs — basically helping out, getting paid cash, not being a registered employee. This summer I had my first real employment at a small mall island selling phone accessories (putting on screen protectors, helping customers choose cases, etc.). Not the best pay, but it helped.\n\nNow things are getting more serious financially, because of my personal situation.\n\nMy current situation\n\n\t•\tI’ve been with my girlfriend for 3.5 years.\n\n\t•\tWe currently live together at her parents’ place. It’s… not ideal for any of us, but for now it’s what we can afford.\n\n\t•\tWe definitely want to move into our own apartment soon — rent around here for an “OK” place is about 300€/month. With my new CNC job salary we could technically do it.\n\n\t•\tShe’s also in her 2nd year of university, but in the medical field.\n\nAdditional income\n\nBesides work, for the last \\~6 months I’ve been fully supporting both of us financially through a mix of jobs and math tutoring for important high-school exams. I currently earn around 400€/month from tutoring alone.\n\nWhat I need advice on\n\nNow that I’m stepping into a more stable job with better income, I want to be smart about it.\n\n1. How can I increase my income long-term?\n\nI’m willing to learn new skills or get certifications relevant to robotics or machining. Anything useful in Eastern Europe is welcome.\n\n2. What should I consider investing in at my age?\n\nI don’t want to do anything risky like crypto gambling. I just want to start building something for the future, even small.\n\n3. Any advice about budgeting or moving out as a young couple while both in university?\n\nI’m ready to take the responsibility; I just want to make sure I’m not rushing into something that will crush us financially.\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this. Life is starting to feel like it’s moving forward and I want to keep the momentum going. Any honest advice is appreciated. 🙏",

    "text": "[Cross-posted] The instability of being chronically ill has me paralyzed trying to figure out what to do after a car accident and I need some advice My car is my lifeline. I do not live in a city where I could use public transport. My car is almost 17 years old, though, and is kind of falling apart. Before I got sick, I took excellent care of the car. I still take good care of it, but the outsides have started showing more wear and tear than I would like, so I've just focused on maintaining the mechanics of the car. \n\nEarlier this week, a friend of mine backed up into my car. Not a ton of damage, but noticeable. I'm getting a second opinion, but the first place I went to said fixing the cosmetic damage would be thousands of dollars. There is, however, a much cheaper fix that doesn't touch the cosmetic issue but makes sure the bumper is secure and safe. My friend won't be putting this through insurance (she's not sure it will be covered because it was a work car and I wasn't hit during a work event) so is paying in cash. \n\nBecause of my illnesses, I have trouble working and am financially doing very poorly. If this was someone I didn't know, I'd get an estimate, have them pay me, and just get the basic repairs so I can pocket the extra cash. Since I know this person, however, I'm feeling torn about what to do. I do not care about my car's exterior and could really use the money. If I do decide to get the basic fix, I really want to ask my friend to reimburse me for the depreciation of the car. The amount I'm thinking would be less than the cost of a complete fix (and probably about what she would have paid in a deductible), so she saves money given the current circumstances. I could really use the money and I know I'm entitled to it, but I just don't want to spend a stupid amount on fixing the outside of a car that looks like crap. I really need the money now. \n\nThis is stressing me out and it's causing flairs. I've been to my therapist and still just don't know what to do or how to keep the cost down. My car is so freaking important, but finances have been a real stressor lately. I don't want to mess this up.",

I'm curious to see how many other people have had to deal with a situation like this.\n\nNew gf and I sit down to do her budget. She's making just under a living wage in a mcol city.\n\nWe figure her take home. Then all her expenses.\n\nAnd there's only $3000 at the end of the year left over for savings.\n\nWe have a discussion on how to cut back on expenses.\n\n\"How much do you have in your bank account right now?\"\n\n\"-300. Wells fargo kept hitting me with overdraft fees\"\n\n\"You know you can turn that off right? You'll have to call customer service.\n\n\"Won't that be a pain in the ass?\"\n\n\"It's probably worth saving 300+ dollars dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess you're right about that\".\n\n\"What about your phone bill. It's $80 a month. Are you on a contract?\n\n\"No it's month to month. I have just always had version\"\n\n\"You spend 90% of your time at home or work with Wi-Fi. Why don't you switch to a mvno? It won't be as good, but you will almost never use it anyways. You'll save like $700.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that was an option \"\n\n\"What about your CBD use?\"\n\n\"I can't cut back on that. I use it to self-medicate my OCD.\"\n\n\"Okay, you know your body. But why do you only buy it from the corner store? Why not online\"\n\n\"Because it's the same price!\"\n\n\"Yeah for a single week. Check the bulk pricing.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's like 40% off if I buy at least a month supply. If I buy three months, it's free shipping\"\n\n\"Okay, that's like another few hundred\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe managed to \"find\" another $2000 in savings for this year. \n\nMy GF is an intelligent person. Well traveled. Grew up with professor parents. Had a college degree. Worked professionally in a white collar job. Etc.\n\nShe had just never thought about how to save money.\n\nI asked her about it. And she didn't really have a good reason:\n\n\"My parents were terrible with money and didn't teach me\"\n\n\\-\"Almost everyone's family is terrible at money. And you're not a kid anymore. You can Google how to save money.\"\n\n\"I'm bad at math\"\n\n\\-\"You have a claculator on your phone. It's not even complex math.\"\n\n\"I get decision fatigue\"\n\n\"That $2000 just saved you a 100+ hours of working. I think it would be worth pushing past the fatigue. \"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nShe's not the first person I've run into with the same handful of excuses. I don't think any of them are the real reason.\n\nI'm leaning towards it being anxiety and avoidance.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?",

The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1i4r3rj/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: /u/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.",

We are Bryon Adinoff, an Addiction Psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and President of Doctors for Drug Policy Reform (D4DPR), and Julio Nunes, a Psychiatry Resident at Yale School of Medicine and board member of D4DPR.\n\nWe recently published the following paper, [\"Challenging the 25-year-old 'mature brain' mythology: Implications for the minimum legal age for non-medical cannabis use\"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00952990.2025.2561982); in the [American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse (AJDAA)](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/iada20). In this perspective, we examined the commonly held belief that the brain keeps maturing until age 25 and then stops. This belief has been used to make policy recommendations for age restrictions for legal substance use, yet there is no evidence that the brain stops developing when we turn 25. Brains mature in a nonlinear fashion, and developmental changes are often region-specific and influenced by sex\nand specific physiological processes.

I think the question is pretty straightforward, although I may be overthinking it: What happens when deposits of rich, hummusy soils go through the geological processes that would otherwise produce familiar rocks?\n\nFor instance, imagine a grassy plain with a deep, rich black soil getting overlaid with volcanic ash, and then allow millions of years of geology and sedimentation to unfold.\n\nIf I were to check back in on that initial deposit, what would I expect to see?\n\nWhen I think of coal-forming deposits, I think of rich peats — but maybe I'm just overthinking it, and black soils therefore become something like a very dirty coal deposit?",

I have a few questions regarding the effects this would have on the planet and how probable this is to occur in the first place.\n\n1. How Probable is a planet to have a Tidally Locked moon and by locked itself?\n\n2. What Size of moon would be most common in this scenario?\n\n3. Assuming this planet has an atmosphere similar to earth. How would this situation effect tectonic movement or placement of oceans?\n\n4. How would the temperature or habitability be effected by this?\n\n5. What Kind of Tidal Weather effects would you expect to see on the planet if this situation occurred?\n\nSorry if that's a lot of questions but this is very interesting and I'm loving learning more about how tidal forces effect planets.

Hi,\n\nAs far as I know mutation is random in the sense that there's no way of predicting where in the genome a mutation will occur, right? And the chances of the same mutation happening independently in two individuals is extremely low - that's why we can compare DNA sequences and work out all kinds of things ranging from paternity tests to phylogenetic trees. \n\nSo why is it that genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis or haemophilia are so common? Do all people with those disorders descend from one common ancestor who had that mutation, too recent to have been eliminated by natural selection? (I've heard it said that Queen Victoria was likely the mutant that started the infamous haemophilia allele in the house of Saxe-Coburg, but surely everyone with haemophilia isn't a descendant of her, are they?) Is the mutation subtly different each time, and \"breaks\" (so to speak) a different part of the gene? Or are some mutations not actually random and there's some factor which makes that part of the gene particularly susceptible to the same mutation several times? Or perhaps all of the above for different genetic conditions?",

I hope someone here could help me figure this out a little better.\n\nWe've all experienced days where there seems to be a constant wind, and days where the wind feels to come in more sudden gusts. I am wondering what sort of conditions (meteorological and topographical) might affect the gustiness of the wind.\n\nFor example, is the wind more constant the higher you go in elevation, since there is less disturbance from the surface?  \nDoes winds at sea tend to be steadier because of the lack of obstacles? How does it change when it reaches the shoreline?  \nDo certain weather conditions \"encourage\" gusty winds, like cloud-cover, rain or heat?\n\nthanks in advance for any help!",

I understand light needs time to travel, and what we see is the light from x years ago. However, I don't understand the expansion of the universe. From my understanding of the big bang, it started as a central point and exploded into what I imagine is a sphere. So if that were true, we would have to position out telescopes towards that center point in the sphere  to see the furthest back. But this isn't true because we can point Hubble anywhere in space and see light from 10+ billion years ago. Also, all of the diagrams on this show like a tunnel with space expanding out from a point, which is how I think about it but likely is not correct. I have trouble understanding how space itself expands and how it influences all the stuff we see in our telescope.",

Or do the words fluorescent and phosphorescent only apply to direct light?\n\nSimilarly, if something is radioluminescent, which is caused by radioactive emissions causing the exictation of phosphorescent molecules, is that phosphorescence? Or just 'something glowing that's radioactive'?\n\nBasically, what I'm asking is 'does it matter *how* the electrons get excited to determine whether you call something fluorescent or phosphorescent, or does it specifically have to be from photoluminscence?",

In this perspective, we examined the commonly held belief that the brain keeps maturing until age 25 and then stops. This belief has been used to make policy recommendations for age restrictions for legal substance use, yet there is no evidence that the brain stops developing when we turn 25. Brains mature in a nonlinear fashion, and developmental changes are often region-specific and influenced by sex\nand specific physiological processes.

I've been working on a science fiction project and am envisioning a Tidally Locked Planet and with a tidally locked moon as well. I have a few questions regarding the effects this would have on the planet and how probable this is to occur in the first place.\n\n1. How Probable is a planet to have a Tidally Locked moon and by locked itself?\n\n2. What Size of moon would be most common in this scenario?\n\n3. Assuming this planet has an atmosphere similar to earth. How would this situation effect tectonic movement or placement of oceans?\n\n4. How would the temperature or habitability be effected by this?\n\n5. What Kind of Tidal Weather effects would you expect to see on the planet if this situation occurred?\n\nSorry if that's a lot of questions but this is very interesting and I'm loving learning more about how tidal forces effect planets.

Hi,\n\nAs far as I know mutation is random in the sense that there's no way of predicting where in the genome a mutation will occur, right? And the chances of the same mutation happening independently in two individuals is extremely low - that's why we can compare DNA sequences and work out all kinds of things ranging from paternity tests to phylogenetic trees. \n\nSo why is it that genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis or haemophilia are so common? Do all people with those disorders descend from one common ancestor who had that mutation, too recent to have been eliminated by natural selection? (I've heard it said that Queen Victoria was likely the mutant that started the infamous haemophilia allele in the house of Saxe-Coburg, but surely everyone with haemophilia isn't a descendant of her, are they?) Is the mutation subtly different each time, and \"breaks\" (so to speak) a different part of the gene? Or are some mutations not actually random and there's some factor which makes that part of the gene particularly susceptible to the same mutation several times? Or perhaps all of the above for different genetic conditions?",

    "text": "Why do space telescopes not need to be pointed towards a certain point in order to see back the furthest in time? I read Hubble is able to see back 13 billion years. I understand light needs time to travel, and what we see is the light from x years ago. However, I don't understand the expansion of the universe. From my understanding of the big bang, it started as a central point and exploded into what I imagine is a sphere. So if that were true, we would have to position out telescopes towards that center point in the sphere  to see the furthest back. But this isn't true because we can point Hubble anywhere in space and see light from 10+ billion years ago. Also, all of the diagrams on this show like a tunnel with space expanding out from a point, which is how I think about it but likely is not correct. I have trouble understanding how space itself expands and how it influences all the stuff we see in our telescope.",

My understanding is this: \n\nFluorescence is when electron excitation gives off light immediately; take away source, light goes away. \n\nPhosphorescence is when this takes a bit longer and something continues to glow.\n\nIf the glow is caused by a chemical reaction, for example white phosphorus reacting with oxygen, is that still classed as being fluorescent? Or do the words fluorescent and phosphorescent only apply to direct light?\n\nSimilarly, if something is radioluminescent, which is caused by radioactive emissions causing the exictation of phosphorescent molecules, is that phosphorescence? Or just 'something glowing that's radioactive'?\n\nBasically, what I'm asking is 'does it matter *how* the electrons get excited to determine whether you call something fluorescent or phosphorescent, or does it specifically have to be from photoluminscence?",

    "text": "The ups and downs of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara In the 10 years since its publication, *A Little Life* has earned quite the polarizing reputation. Some say it's the saddest/most devastating book they've ever read. Others say it's trauma porn. I'm here to say that I think it can be both, and that I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I don't know if it's correct to say that I *enjoyed* reading this book, but I can certainly say that I found it to be incredibly engaging and worthy of a personal score of 9/10 regarding my opinion of its quality as a work of art.\n\nSelfishly, part of the motivation behind me writing this post at all is simply a means of reflecting on my own thoughts/feelings for my own personal benefit. But since I like to share and yap with strangers online, I wanted to do it in a way that possibly generated discussion too! Sorry friends, this is gonna be a pretty long post, but it's a pretty long book!\n\n**Tl;dr** \\- If you hated this book, I get it. If you loved this book, I get that too. I wouldn't consider either opinion to be invalid or off-base.\n\n**What I didn't like and/or Why I can understand people disliking this book**\n\nThe sheer magnitude and quantity of absolutely horrific things that happen to one person over the course of their life in this book is, if we're being honest, so statistically unlikely that it absolutely causes a kind of existential frustration if you're a reader who needs their realistic fiction to feel plausible. There's a certain level of suspension of disbelief that is required to read this book and not feel completely overwhelmed by the simple improbability of it all. This is where the \"porn\" part of trauma porn comes in most for me. It definitely hits a gratuitous level of negativity at points.\n\nSome people really struggle with reading flawed characters, characters who make the kind of mistakes that the readers themselves would never forgive if they were on the receiving end of them. Some people are left feeling deeply unsatisfied if there doesn't feel like there's a moral to the story and/or a valuable perspective gained by the protagonist(s) through character development. If that describes you as a reader (and I don't at all mean this judgmentally) I highly doubt you'd enjoy reading this book.\n\nTrigger warnings. This book has SO MANY possible triggers for people. SA, domestic abuse, parental favoritism, childhood abandonment, pedophilia, self-harm/talk of suicide, and probably more I'm failing to mention. If you cannot read books with any of those topics presented (again, completely non-judgmentally) this book is absolutely not for you.\n\nLastly (and the most tame reason), while several of the characters do not come from money and are not well off financially, there's still a sort of pretentious hoity-toity aura to the characters because they're well-educated (from what appears to be a very prestigious American University, but it's never named) and basically all of their peers are cut from that same cloth. That, combined with the fact that many of them are in the professional arts of some sort, it's just a personality type that not everybody will enjoy reading. In fact I'd *almost* argue you'd have to have known/been close to at least one person who is similar to one (but hopefully several) of the characters in order to gravitate towards this book.\n\n**What I did like about this book**\n\nWhen I think of the phrase \"trauma porn\" I think about something where the traumatic events themselves are the things that keep me coming back, lusting for them in a \"fuck me up fam, make me want to curl into the fetal position and sob\" kind of way. But that's not what kept me coming back to reading this book. As I mentioned just above, it helps tremendously to have known characters in real life who are similar to those in this book. And I have absolutely been close to several people in my life (as well as directly relating to some of them as an individual) who these characters reminded me of, in both positive and negative ways. As such, I kept coming back to reading this book because these characters felt so *human* to me. In their ups and their downs, their rationale, while often deeply flawed, resonated very strongly and evoked a deep empathy within me for myriad reasons. I didn't keep coming back to get hurt, I kept coming back because I was interested in their stories.\n\nFor as aggressively upsetting as many aspects of this book were, there were some unbelievably heartwarming parts as well. The lowest lows helped emphasize the highest highs and vice versa. They ebbed and flowed throughout the book in such a way that kept me on my toes and encouraged me to keep going. I finished this book in 8 days, which means I averaged right about 100 pages per day, just shy of 38,000 words per day. But there were days I didn't read it at all, and days where I read twice that much. It was easy to just keep reading from a prose and continuity perspective.\n\nOn a basic level, these is obviously a catharsis which comes from the emotional release of a book like this if it hits right. And I can absolutely say that it hit right for me. I'm no stranger to crying while reading, but it's typically from moments of overwhelming joy, the cataclysmic relief of tension when something happy/joyous occurs. And that absolutely happened here, but it also went beyond that. This is the first book that has ever gotten me to cry over something that was heartbreakingly sad.\n\nIf you've never known somebody like Jude in your life, somebody who has such a punishingly negative opinion of their own self worth, this book probably won't feel very realistic to you. But as somebody who has spent time around people who view themselves in that harsh of a light, I think Yanagihara did a phenomenal job at capturing the essence of that kind of person's level of public masking and internal turmoil, of their utter unwillingness to believe that anything truly good can be happening to them, or that they somehow don't deserve those good things. It was painful to read, but it did feel authentic to that experience. And in addition to that, I think she really nailed the reactive elements of loved ones confronted with the realities that a person like Jude faces. Those also were painful to read for countless reasons, but once again authentic to the experience. Or at least, authentic to my own experience.\n\nI thought this was an incredibly well-done character study of a person who somehow managed to find some surface-level success despite society itself having failed him at absolutely every possible step on his way to adulthood, and the social elements that go along with it.",

I’ve been noticing lately that I’ll happily follow certain unlikable or outright terrible protagonists for hundreds of pages, but in other books a character makes one mildly annoying choice and I’m immediately out. It made me wonder what actually tips the balance. Is it the writing, the character’s voice, the pacing, or just whether they’re “compelling” in some hard‑to-define way? The contrast hit me after finishing a novel where the main character was a complete disaster of a person, yet I couldn’t stop reading because the author made their spiral strangely fascinating. Then I picked up another book with a much milder “messy” lead and found myself getting irrationally irritated two chapters in. I’m trying to figure out what the difference was. Well, Curious how other people think about this. What makes you stick with (or give up on) an unlikable protagonist?",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 6 - The Lady or The Tiger by Frank Stockton Hehe it was hilarious story. I looked up some discussions of this one and it seems that this is a well analysed story. While most analyses focus on &gt;!love vs jealousy, here's my take on the book. The author, through this story, exposes the human bias where in people believe that *they* could do no wrong, but the *other* most definitely would. Especially one described as barbaric and jealous - because after all *we a*re well aware how those feelings affects us and what someone in that situation would do, essentially meaning that we ourselves might choose the *other's* choice of action, despite feeling assured that there's no way we would.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*I would rather starve than steal, but surely the poor wretch could bear his hunger no longer and resorted to stealing. I can understand, but I could never do the same, for I am better.*!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*This barbaric princess would surely throw the man to the tiger, but I would surely choose love, because I am better. The princess however, is barbaric after all. Besides we all know how jealously can drive you to murder. We all know that feeling intimately. But surely, given the power over someone's fate, I would choose better.*!&lt;\n\nEssentially it forces us to face ourselves. Not in the choice of love, trust or security. But rather in knowing what we are capable of, and then, knowing how barbaric our choice would be, and then choosing better because of that knowledge. Perhaps out of pride or dignity, or perhaps out of good sense and morality. To know your monsters is to tame them but many refuse to face this very reality. Therefore, this taunting story.\n\n  \nMy [Day 5 read](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pihzk3/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) here.

I’ve been noticing lately that I’ll happily follow certain unlikable or outright terrible protagonists for hundreds of pages, but in other books a character makes one mildly annoying choice and I’m immediately out. It made me wonder what actually tips the balance. Is it the writing, the character’s voice, the pacing, or just whether they’re “compelling” in some hard‑to-define way? The contrast hit me after finishing a novel where the main character was a complete disaster of a person, yet I couldn’t stop reading because the author made their spiral strangely fascinating. Then I picked up another book with a much milder “messy” lead and found myself getting irrationally irritated two chapters in. I’m trying to figure out what the difference was. Well, Curious how other people think about this. What makes you stick with (or give up on) an unlikable protagonist?",

Not trying to give any spoiler but the book is amazing. \nWhen you start reading the book it feels like \"okay maybe it's one of those usual horror books but with a different background\" but only when you're 40% into it, you get to know that there is more depth. It has so much of emotions proportionately mixed that the overall story doesn't seem to be clichè. You can't blame any of the characters and feel sorry for all. Such a masterful writing and presentation.\nWhat are your thoughts about the book? Telk me without spoilers.",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 6 - The Lady or The Tiger by Frank Stockton Hehe it was hilarious story. I looked up some discussions of this one and it seems that this is a well analysed story. While most analyses focus on &gt;!love vs jealousy, here's my take on the book. The author, through this story, exposes the human bias where in people believe that *they* could do no wrong, but the *other* most definitely would. Especially one described as barbaric and jealous - because after all *we a*re well aware how those feelings affects us and what someone in that situation would do, essentially meaning that we ourselves might choose the *other's* choice of action, despite feeling assured that there's no way we would.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*I would rather starve than steal, but surely the poor wretch could bear his hunger no longer and resorted to stealing. I can understand, but I could never do the same, for I am better.*!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*This barbaric princess would surely throw the man to the tiger, but I would surely choose love, because I am better. The princess however, is barbaric after all. Besides we all know how jealously can drive you to murder. We all know that feeling intimately. But surely, given the power over someone's fate, I would choose better.*!&lt;\n\nEssentially it forces us to face ourselves. Not in the choice of love, trust or security. But rather in knowing what we are capable of, and then, knowing how barbaric our choice would be, and then choosing better because of that knowledge. Perhaps out of pride or dignity, or perhaps out of good sense and morality. To know your monsters is to tame them but many refuse to face this very reality. Therefore, this taunting story.\n\n  \nMy [Day 5 read](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pihzk3/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) here.

    "text": "The ups and downs of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara In the 10 years since its publication, *A Little Life* has earned quite the polarizing reputation. Some say it's the saddest/most devastating book they've ever read. Others say it's trauma porn. I'm here to say that I think it can be both, and that I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I don't know if it's correct to say that I *enjoyed* reading this book, but I can certainly say that I found it to be incredibly engaging and worthy of a personal score of 9/10 regarding my opinion of its quality as a work of art.\n\nSelfishly, part of the motivation behind me writing this post at all is simply a means of reflecting on my own thoughts/feelings for my own personal benefit. But since I like to share and yap with strangers online, I wanted to do it in a way that possibly generated discussion too! Sorry friends, this is gonna be a pretty long post, but it's a pretty long book!\n\n**Tl;dr** \\- If you hated this book, I get it. If you loved this book, I get that too. I wouldn't consider either opinion to be invalid or off-base.\n\n**What I didn't like and/or Why I can understand people disliking this book**\n\nThe sheer magnitude and quantity of absolutely horrific things that happen to one person over the course of their life in this book is, if we're being honest, so statistically unlikely that it absolutely causes a kind of existential frustration if you're a reader who needs their realistic fiction to feel plausible. There's a certain level of suspension of disbelief that is required to read this book and not feel completely overwhelmed by the simple improbability of it all. This is where the \"porn\" part of trauma porn comes in most for me. It definitely hits a gratuitous level of negativity at points.\n\nSome people really struggle with reading flawed characters, characters who make the kind of mistakes that the readers themselves would never forgive if they were on the receiving end of them. Some people are left feeling deeply unsatisfied if there doesn't feel like there's a moral to the story and/or a valuable perspective gained by the protagonist(s) through character development. If that describes you as a reader (and I don't at all mean this judgmentally) I highly doubt you'd enjoy reading this book.\n\nTrigger warnings. This book has SO MANY possible triggers for people. SA, domestic abuse, parental favoritism, childhood abandonment, pedophilia, self-harm/talk of suicide, and probably more I'm failing to mention. If you cannot read books with any of those topics presented (again, completely non-judgmentally) this book is absolutely not for you.\n\nLastly (and the most tame reason), while several of the characters do not come from money and are not well off financially, there's still a sort of pretentious hoity-toity aura to the characters because they're well-educated (from what appears to be a very prestigious American University, but it's never named) and basically all of their peers are cut from that same cloth. That, combined with the fact that many of them are in the professional arts of some sort, it's just a personality type that not everybody will enjoy reading. In fact I'd *almost* argue you'd have to have known/been close to at least one person who is similar to one (but hopefully several) of the characters in order to gravitate towards this book.\n\n**What I did like about this book**\n\nWhen I think of the phrase \"trauma porn\" I think about something where the traumatic events themselves are the things that keep me coming back, lusting for them in a \"fuck me up fam, make me want to curl into the fetal position and sob\" kind of way. But that's not what kept me coming back to reading this book. As I mentioned just above, it helps tremendously to have known characters in real life who are similar to those in this book. And I have absolutely been close to several people in my life (as well as directly relating to some of them as an individual) who these characters reminded me of, in both positive and negative ways. As such, I kept coming back to reading this book because these characters felt so *human* to me. In their ups and their downs, their rationale, while often deeply flawed, resonated very strongly and evoked a deep empathy within me for myriad reasons. I didn't keep coming back to get hurt, I kept coming back because I was interested in their stories.\n\nFor as aggressively upsetting as many aspects of this book were, there were some unbelievably heartwarming parts as well. The lowest lows helped emphasize the highest highs and vice versa. They ebbed and flowed throughout the book in such a way that kept me on my toes and encouraged me to keep going. I finished this book in 8 days, which means I averaged right about 100 pages per day, just shy of 38,000 words per day. But there were days I didn't read it at all, and days where I read twice that much. It was easy to just keep reading from a prose and continuity perspective.\n\nOn a basic level, these is obviously a catharsis which comes from the emotional release of a book like this if it hits right. And I can absolutely say that it hit right for me. I'm no stranger to crying while reading, but it's typically from moments of overwhelming joy, the cataclysmic relief of tension when something happy/joyous occurs. And that absolutely happened here, but it also went beyond that. This is the first book that has ever gotten me to cry over something that was heartbreakingly sad.\n\nIf you've never known somebody like Jude in your life, somebody who has such a punishingly negative opinion of their own self worth, this book probably won't feel very realistic to you. But as somebody who has spent time around people who view themselves in that harsh of a light, I think Yanagihara did a phenomenal job at capturing the essence of that kind of person's level of public masking and internal turmoil, of their utter unwillingness to believe that anything truly good can be happening to them, or that they somehow don't deserve those good things. It was painful to read, but it did feel authentic to that experience. And in addition to that, I think she really nailed the reactive elements of loved ones confronted with the realities that a person like Jude faces. Those also were painful to read for countless reasons, but once again authentic to the experience. Or at least, authentic to my own experience.\n\nI thought this was an incredibly well-done character study of a person who somehow managed to find some surface-level success despite society itself having failed him at absolutely every possible step on his way to adulthood, and the social elements that go along with it.",

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many \"suggest some books\" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

Lately I’ve been picking up new releases and seeing blurbs that promise “a once‑in‑a‑generation masterpiece” or “the most important novel you’ll read this decade,” and then the book itself is... Just okay. You know? So 100%. Okay so Still enjoyable, but nowhere near the cosmic event the marketing makes it sound like. It almost feels like every title has to be sold as life‑altering just to stand out, and it ends up flattening the real gems. I’m curious if this is just me getting more sensitive to marketing language, or if others feel like the blurbs have drifted from enthusiastic to borderline parody.

I looked up some discussions of this one and it seems that this is a well analysed story. While most analyses focus on &gt;!love vs jealousy, here's my take on the book. The author, through this story, exposes the human bias where in people believe that *they* could do no wrong, but the *other* most definitely would. Especially one described as barbaric and jealous - because after all *we a*re well aware how those feelings affects us and what someone in that situation would do, essentially meaning that we ourselves might choose the *other's* choice of action, despite feeling assured that there's no way we would.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*I would rather starve than steal, but surely the poor wretch could bear his hunger no longer and resorted to stealing. I can understand, but I could never do the same, for I am better.*!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*This barbaric princess would surely throw the man to the tiger, but I would surely choose love, because I am better. The princess however, is barbaric after all. Besides we all know how jealously can drive you to murder. We all know that feeling intimately. But surely, given the power over someone's fate, I would choose better.*!&lt;\n\nEssentially it forces us to face ourselves. Not in the choice of love, trust or security. But rather in knowing what we are capable of, and then, knowing how barbaric our choice would be, and then choosing better because of that knowledge. Perhaps out of pride or dignity, or perhaps out of good sense and morality. To know your monsters is to tame them but many refuse to face this very reality. Therefore, this taunting story.\n\n  \nMy [Day 5 read](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pihzk3/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) here.

Not trying to give any spoiler but the book is amazing. \nWhen you start reading the book it feels like \"okay maybe it's one of those usual horror books but with a different background\" but only when you're 40% into it, you get to know that there is more depth. It has so much of emotions proportionately mixed that the overall story doesn't seem to be clichè. You can't blame any of the characters and feel sorry for all. Such a masterful writing and presentation.\nWhat are your thoughts about the book? Telk me without spoilers.",

    "text": "Confronting Evil - DO NOT READ Confronting Evil by Bill O’Reilly is sold as a nonfiction book about some of the worst villains throughout history, and the events that resulted from their actions. I was really excited to read this book. It seemed interesting, and I was curious about the conditions and personalities that lead to atrocities. I quit in the third chapter because NONE OF IT IS PROPERLY RESEARCHED. O’Reilly made an accusation against king Henry VIII that didn’t seem right, and was in fact disproved by the shallowest google search possible. I then went to the book’s reference section. Of the 11 chapters most have less than 5 sources, and all these sources seem to be for things like newspaper articles and population data, not biographical information. His chapter on New Orleans slaver has ONE SOURCE. This could have been a really cool book, and it is instead a massive waste of time. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the library instead of paying good money for it. If you’re interested in nonfiction, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Just finished Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Octavia Butler was phenomenal - prophetic, really - in imagining the world of 2025 from 1993. Sure, some of the problems are more severe, a little more dystopic, but she was keyed into the right issues - climate, societal collapse, racism, etc.\n\nThis was a challenging novel to read because the setting is so dark. The struggle of the characters to survive is unrelenting. But the novel isn't simply about surviving, it's about the protagonist's attempt to sow something new in the midst of destruction. I don't know that I ever got fully on board Lauren Olamina's \"Earthseed\" religion and God as Change, but I still found encouragement and some lightness in how Lauren found companions and support through cooperation in the midst of a veritable Californian Mad Max world.\n\nOne of the few scifi elements in the book is Lauren's hyperempathy - as a result of her mother's drug abuse during pregnancy, Lauren is able to telepathically experience the sensations of other people - predominantly pain, but also pleasure, as little of it as there is in her life. I would have expected this to play more of a role in Earthseed, but it didn't seem to.\n\nI'll probably read a few other books in the interim, but I definitely want to pick up Parable of the Talents before long.",

I’m fast approaching a milestone birthday, and as I head into a new decade I’m trying to broaden my reading habits a bit. Tackling harder books, trying the classics (Of which I’ve read very little) and pushing myself beyond my usual genres as I tend to stick to what I know. I’m not pretending to be “well read” in any intellectual sense (and that’s not really the goal), but I do want to challenge myself more and try new things.\n\nBecause this is the internet in 2025, I’ll put in a disclaimer that I’m not implying that certain genres, authors, or anything “commercial” is lesser somehow. Nor do I consider myself well read or intellectual - I read what I enjoy, hence the challenge. No book shaming here. \n\nWhat I am curious about is the habits of people who would consider themselves well read or who read more intellectually. How often do you pick up something that wouldn’t be considered “literary”? Things like a typical murder mystery, a beach read, a popcorn thriller, a fantasy romance etc?\n\nDo you read mostly with purpose, or does fun/easy reading still have a place in your routine?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Why is he giving us Orkideh’s perspective after she has died in the narrative? And on that note, how is the narrative perspective of any of these characters justified at all? The lack of any sort of justified narrative distance of any of the narrators (except for maybe Cyrus a little bit) is absolutely jarring for me. And why does it feel like every character is plucked straight from a cookie cutter version of a person? Almost no one felt super like able to me except for maybe Zee and even he felt more just like a narrative tool than a person. I have so many questions about specific things in the book that didn’t land for me. Nearly every time two characters were talking in this book it felt so forced and cringey. How did this get so many accolades?\n\nSorry I’m just needing to rant a little. Based on what I’ve seen most of you like this book but man it just didn’t cut it at all for me.

Think of this as a contextual nudge so you can just hop on the ride and enjoy the twists and turns yet to come that leave your jaw on the GROUND.\n\nOkay so long story short: it is the longest book that you never want to end and perhaps the greatest revenge story ever told. The first 100 pages have the narration putting the reader ''in the know''. What that means is YOU see more than Dante than does. And what you see is an innocent young man get his life ***completely destroyed*** without having done anything to deserve it. Like, literally nothing. Nada. Zilch.  It's almost comical in how petty it is. He's thrown in prison with NO idea why but you do.\n\nThen the narration FLIPS after a couple of hundred pages... suddenly Dante knows more than YOU do as the reader and it remains that way for the rest of the book. He's out of prison. He knows who did this. He knows who destroyed him. And it is payback time. And, you, my dear reader are just there for the ride and what a ride is!\n\nA lot of people get put off by the length which is a shame but I think people should go in with this as the bare minimum when scared of its length. The book is a ROLLERCOASTER and justifies every page it has.\n\n# Quick Note: (edit)\n\nPenguin English Classic edition is the one you want. There are many translations and controversy surrounding them. That's one of the best.\n\n\n\n# Edit 2:\n\nFor those of you have read it, please remember not to spoil for the new readers I am trying to promote the book to.

    "text": "Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. (1840; nonfiction) In 1834, a Harvard undergraduate has to drop out of college in his junior year after an attack of measles affects his eyesight. Richard Henry Dana, Jr., decides that a good spell of sea air, hard work, and no studying would improve his health, so he signs on as a common sailor aboard the merchant ship *Pilgrim*, bound from Boston around the Horn and onward to California. \n\nIt’s an unusual decision for a young man of his class and prospects. Living in the forecastle in damp, cramped, dark, and smelly conditions, \"foremast jacks\" labored hard six or more days a week, often exposed to the worst weather; ate salt beef and hardtack; received little or no medical care; and had no say aboard ship. There the captain—no matter how unstable, unfair, or vicious—reigned with absolute authority, \"lord paramount\" as Dana calls him. \n\nWith a good captain, the system works despite its hardships, but under a bad one, sailors suffer. After Dana witnesses the unjust flogging of two men, he vows to someday \"do something to redress the grievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings, of whom I then was one,\" and this book marks one attempt to do that.\n\nDana is an attractive figure. Not brought up to manual labor and just recovering from an illness, he's nevertheless always game, ready to jump into the hardest work. At first he's exhausted after two hours of swabbing the deck, but he soon becomes strong and active, springing up into the rigging with the best of them. He's enterprising in other ways too, as when he teaches himself Spanish by borrowing a grammar and dictionary and listening closely to conversations. He also has an endearing interest in other people, and his passages describing them are some of the best in the book.\n\nMany readers will be entranced by the life-at-sea narrative, with its storms and floggings and men overboard, icebergs and whales, jib-booms and knight-heads and royal-yards. Surprisingly to me though, where Dana's account really takes off and becomes riveting is when he gets to the California coast. These chapters are packed with fascinating observations about the people, customs, trade, and geography.   \n  \nThis is California before the Gold Rush, before palm trees, when it was a foreign country: a backwater Mexican possession with little to trade beyond hides, horns, and tallow. Few towns boast more than a crumbling mission and presidio and a scattering of small one-story adobe houses. San Pedro and San Diego are even less developed, and San Francisco Bay is almost deserted.\n\nAs a Boston Yankee, Dana can hardly stand it. “In the hands of an enterprising people, what a country this might be!” He sees rich potential everywhere, often with great prescience, as when he says of San Francisco Bay:  \n\n\n&gt;If California ever becomes a prosperous country, this bay will be the centre of its prosperity. The abundance of wood and water, the extreme fertility of its shores, the excellence of its climate, which is as near to being perfect as any in the world, and its facilities for navigation, affording the best anchoring-grounds in the whole western coast of America, all fit it for a place of great importance. \n\nAn appendix to the book published 24 years after the 1840 original describes Dana’s return visit to San Francisco, now a bustling city, and everywhere he goes people quote this passage back to him. His was the only existing account of northern California, found in many a prospector's back pocket.\n\nAlthough he calls Spanish Californians idle and thriftless, Dana doesn't automatically dislike foreigners. He gives the Spanish credit where he feels it's due. He has nothing but praise for the Hawaiians, called Sandwich Islanders or their own name for themselves, Kanaka, in the book. They crew ships all around the Pacific, and some also have temporary work at the hide-houses where Dana spends several months working on shore. Of these men, he writes:  \n\n\n&gt;They were the most interesting, intelligent, and kind-hearted people that I ever fell in with. I felt a positive attachment for almost all of them; and many of them I have, to this time, a feeling for, which would lead me to go a great way for the mere pleasure of seeing them, and which will always make me feel a strong interest in the mere name of a Sandwich Islander.\n\nHe thinks very highly of their character as well, and becomes a sort of blood-brother to one of the Hawaiians.  \n\nThe book is full of interesting observations on the manners, customs, clothes, food, appearance, houses, and entertainments of the various sets of people in California, and fascinating glimpses into a lost world:  \n\n\n&gt;Horses are the cheapest thing in California; the very best not being worth more than ten dollars apiece, and very good ones being often sold for three, and four. In taking a day's ride, you pay for the use of the saddle, and for the labor and trouble of catching the horses. If you bring the saddle back safe, they care but little what becomes of the horse.\n\nThough the above passage is the sort of thing I love Dana for, the book does have plenty of exciting sea stuff, especially a harrowing return trip round the Horn. Patrick O'Brian drew upon Dana's account, and fans of the Aubrey-Maturin series may find some interesting parallels, especially the naturalist Professor Nuttall, who much like Stephen Maturin expresses great disappointment with the ship's captain refuses to stop at an uninhabited island, in the middle of difficult ship maneuvers, so he can do some botanizing.\n\nAll in all, Dana’s memoir is entertaining and fascinating as hell. Can’t recommend enough.",

    "text": "Advice on how to approach continental philosophy (specifically Heidegger) Hello, everyone!\n\nI‘ve been wondering about this for some time and could really use some help. I‘m fairly new to philosophy and it’s a lot different from what I expected. My lifelong idea of philosophy (as a layperson) apparently lines up more with what‘s called analytic philosophy (of which I’ve only read one essay), with its emphasis on logic and systematic argumentation.\n\nI’ve only read some works of Sartre and Heidegger so far and I‘m honestly not sure how to approach them. I have enjoyed reading Heidegger despite the difficulty (I did have to lean a little bit on explainer videos), but **when I thought of challenging myself by writing a brief response essay, I hit a wall. I thought about it for a few days and realized that I enjoyed Heidegger like I enjoy poetry or a work of fiction, not as a rigorous argument that I could try to question or disprove or add to. Because how do I respond to claims like earth, sky, divinities, mortals are a fourfold which are stayed by the thing when it things (I’m sorry if I’m misremembering; it’s been a while)?** **These seem to me less like claims that can be argued with (I guess what I mean is falsifiable) than myth-making.** They’re lovely to read and imagine but I don’t understand how we’re supposed to take them any more seriously than a sustained myth or use them as tools to think about the world. I’ve been wanting to read Hubert Dreyfuss’s work on Heidegger and AI for a while, but now I’m thinking, how can we build robust arguments about something like this on top of what feels like a fanciful foundation?\n\nI apologize if any of this came across as disparaging. I’m not trying to imply that Heidegger or continental philosophy lacks rigor or value. **My goal here is to understand what I’m missing and see the possibilities that so many other people obviously can** (including analytic philosophers, many of whom have written on Heidegger).\n\n**If this is too broad, a specific question would be, how can I engage with an essay like The Thing? How do I go about responding to it? What questions should I be asking myself or the text?**",

    "text": "Returned to Tolkien after years Today, after years and years, I returned to reread the Lord of the Rings. I have now only read the first chapter, but I almost feel like both laughing and crying.\n\nI first read the trilogy as a 12-14 year-old, can't remember exactly when. Then later in a second time (with merely skimming some parts) in high school. After that, haven't read it, though I started a couple of times but never went through with it.\n\nSo now, today, I felt the time had come, opened the first book. As I said, I've only read the first chapter so far, but: for one, I feel like returning to a long-lost friend, like finding again a comfortable corner in an old, cosy room, a place of which I did, in fact, have memory. I feel like I reconnected with something long-forgotten and something well-missed and loved. Second: I had forgotten how clever and genuinely funny Tolkien's writing is. I'm sure the tone changes once events set on the darker paths, but still, I didn't remember how playful, even, at least the beginning of the book is. And how wonderfully the writing in general flows. Like a Prancing Pony of sorts, in text form. Third: returning to the small to massive events of the story, the characters, the world in general, hits different now, as a thirty-something. I can't wait to dive deeper into this masterpiece, with, it feels, new eyes and heart. I almost feel like I'm reading the book for the first time, while simultaneously knowing the plot. Somehow this makes it even better.\n\nI have read the Hobbit, obviously, but no other Tolkien's works (aside LOTR). I habe recently acquired Silmarillion and Fall of Gondoling, and I already can't wait to read those!\n\n  \nHabe you had similar experiences with Tolkien or other writers or works? Or, perhaps, experiences entirely different when you returned to a literary work years later? What about concerning LOTR specifically?",

    "text": "Audiobooks in books? I generally like reading older novels, set in pre-internet/digital technology age, so as I’ve had to read more modern books, I always find it interesting when they include things smartphones and texting and social media, to see how they add to the story. I also like fiction about books (readers, bookshops, libraries) too, and it sort of just occurred to me, that I’ve never come across a book where a character was listening to an audiobook, which would be something kind of commonplace now.\n\nHas anyone ever come across a book where a character was listening to an audiobook? If so, which one? Was it just a minor detail, i.e. to set the scene, or was it more significant?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the replies! I especially love the personal experiences about books on tape when they were CDs/cassettes!",

    "text": "John Updike's Rabbit books Yesterday I bought all 4 of John Updike's Rabbit books at the library bookstore, as well as Licks of Love. Which has Rabbit Remembered. \n\nI do find the premise really interesting. Seeing America from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s from Rabbit and Updike's point of view. I've read many reviews of the series, and some love it, while others hate it. I do like how descriptive Updike makes the scenes- but he goes WAY too overboard with descriptiveness sometimes, to the point where it takes 10 pages to do what should be done in 1, and you just see these walls of text. There was a sex scene early on in the book, and it wasn't very good. It kind of feels like nihilistic historical fiction like Catcher in the Rye. Rabbit really isn't a great person, but I still like seeing the world from his point of view. \n\nI'm wondering if I should read these or just sell them as a set. Yesterday was the first time I even heard about the Rabbit books. It never really got major literary recognition, Rabbit Run was the only one to get a movie, and it is fairly difficult to read and understand what is going on. Some consider it as an important work of American cultural fiction, and other Redditors had to read the book as part of high school or college classes. My local library doesn't even carry the books. \n\nI do really like how Rabbit, Run transported me to 60s Pennsylvania, and really captures how this town feels. But besides descriptions of the scenery, there really isn't much there. The scenery and descriptions are great, but it doesn't feel like the characters are there to maintain my interest in the story.\n\nAnd please try to keep the thread about what YOU think about the Rabbit books. I don't want some lecture about how I should think. I don't want some lecture criticizing what I consider as important literature or what my library should carry. Keep this thread about what you think of the Rabbit books. If you've never read any of the Rabbit books, don't comment.",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 5 - \"A Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov A delightful read! Fun, hilarious and familiar. Considering the difficulties I faced when reading \"The Lady with the Dog\", I'd say this story was a breeze. And not for the writing, which doesn't seem to be easier in any way, but perhaps because the setting is simpler to follow. The crux of the story too, is relatable enough, that even modern day stand-ups exist on this topic.\n\nThe theme of the story is timeless, infinite, and captures the very nature of life - it's duality. From the title you may guess that it is a story about chameleon-like behavior of a person with questionable morals. The story excellently captures the ordinary, making it a classic and setting it apart. You might as well be reminded of an​ occurrence just earlier this week or month in your life, while reading about this two-toned opportunist and the makeshift conference formed of people crowding about a sudden activity.\n\n&gt;!The story mentions a character as red haired. Is this information important and conveys something? Or is it simply a little tidbit of characterization?!&lt;\n\nThank you as always, for the support and discussions.

    "text": "On Bullshit by Harry G. Frankfurt This one is so short, it really qualifies as an essay. But, one edition is between two covers, so I guess it counts as a book.\n\nI snagged it from my local library because of Modern Day Oracles or Bullshit Machines and Calling Bullshit courses by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin D. West, University of Washington. I figured some background wouldn’t hurt and might help me. I found it didn’t help as much as I’d hoped, but I was still entertained.\n\nWhat’s it about? Frankfurt tries (successfully) to define bullshit (rather academically). In short, a bullshit artist is solely focused on persuasion and making an impression, not caring about truth. Paradoxically, bullshit can be true. \n\nWhat makes it bullshit is how it is created - shoddily, hastily and without regard for fine work. A gifted liar does their thing carefully so that the truth cannot be found out. A bullshit artist just flings it out, overwhelming skepticism with sheer volume, until something sticks with the audience. \n\nNow the downside is that **On Bullshit** is written in a dry academic form, citing references, historical uses and changes over time. Not very exciting reading. But it does build up for Frankfurt’s final stinger and one that does get you to think. It’s also proof that there is a sense of humor lurking in the mind that wrote **On Bullshit**. But it’s not bullshit. \n\n7 out of 10. ★★★★★★★",

    "text": "Is The Poisonwood Bible an allegory about US foreign policy in the 1960s? In sending missionary Reverend Nathan Price to Congo, America did not send its best and brightest.  \n\nFrom not listening to the natives who are trying to help (Mama Tataba warning Nathan about the poisonwood tree, and replanting the garden), the unconscious arrogance of assuming that what works in America will likewise work overseas (Nathan and Leah planting seeds from the US, instead of planting fruits and vegetables native to the region, and also reversing Mama Tataba's work in said garden), Nathan's disrespect of local customs (the diatribe against nakedness), steamrolling a policy over the objections of the community (his single-minded obsession with river baptism, when the Congolese keep their children away from the river after a crocodile killed a girl), ignoring the warnings from people who have been their longer and are more familiar with Congo (The Underdowns informing Price that Belgium will evacuate Leopoldville and the Prices should also leave)...\n\nIn the character of Nathan Price, I see America's experience in Vietnam writ large.\n\nAnd lest you think that the Reverend will bring his flock to Jesus with love and compassion, think again.  Reverend Price's God is from the Old Testament.  His is a wrathful, vengeful, harsh god.  His sermons burst with hellfire and damnation, sin and punishment.  The log in his eye blinds him to how he alienates the Congolese with his every action.  The more I read, the more I am convinced that Price's parishioners in Georgia tithed and donated just to get him away from them.\n\nMaybe it's an indictment of colonialism in general.  Either way, it's a fascinating read.  Unlike some books where authors throw in foreign words now and then to let you know the setting, I feel immersed in 1960s Congo.  And knowing what I do about Patrice Lumumba, the CIA, and the Belgian evacuation from the Congo, I shudder to think what is in store for the Prices--and if there is anything that can shake Nathan Price from his arrogant, intolerant, judgmental certainty that he is doing God's will.",

    "text": "Fiction Book Geography - Does anyone get it right? I'm thinking about this right now as I read Kristin Hannah's *The Women*, where she doesn't seem to know that San Diego and Los Angeles are distinct cities that are a few hours' drive from each other. But it comes up all the time in books, even quite good books. For example, reading the *Game of Thrones* series, it felt like people were just zipping up and down Westeros at a moment's notice despite worldbuilding implying that these places are quite far from each other.\n\nAre there books where the author does a great job of making the geography of their world -- whether real or fictional, contemporary or historical -- feel realistic? Or the converse, can you think of a book with a laughably bad sense of internal geography?\n\nI'm leaving nonfiction books out of this, since presumably the people who write them have the actual facts of how space and distance works in their setting.",

Hill has finally followed in his dad's footsteps and produced his own magnum opus.  This 850-pager sprawls over decades and follows a group of friends who, through some arcane processes, bring a dragon into the world...that demands regular sacrifices.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it.  When the storytelling seems like it slows down WHOMP we're put right into the middle of a car chase.  When there's not enough mystery, suddenly we introduce more elements in a bit of a magic quest.  King-like heartbreak?  Yep, that's in there too.  Although I put a spoiler tag on this, that's more for the comments - I don't enjoy spoiling it for anyone.  I will say that there are a few Stephen King Easter eggs in here, but that Hill stands on his own.",

    "text": "The ups and downs of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara In the 10 years since its publication, *A Little Life* has earned quite the polarizing reputation. Some say it's the saddest/most devastating book they've ever read. Others say it's trauma porn. I'm here to say that I think it can be both, and that I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I don't know if it's correct to say that I *enjoyed* reading this book, but I can certainly say that I found it to be incredibly engaging and worthy of a personal score of 9/10 regarding my opinion of its quality as a work of art.\n\nSelfishly, part of the motivation behind me writing this post at all is simply a means of reflecting on my own thoughts/feelings for my own personal benefit. But since I like to share and yap with strangers online, I wanted to do it in a way that possibly generated discussion too! Sorry friends, this is gonna be a pretty long post, but it's a pretty long book!\n\n**Tl;dr** \\- If you hated this book, I get it. If you loved this book, I get that too. I wouldn't consider either opinion to be invalid or off-base.\n\n**What I didn't like and/or Why I can understand people disliking this book**\n\nThe sheer magnitude and quantity of absolutely horrific things that happen to one person over the course of their life in this book is, if we're being honest, so statistically unlikely that it absolutely causes a kind of existential frustration if you're a reader who needs their realistic fiction to feel plausible. There's a certain level of suspension of disbelief that is required to read this book and not feel completely overwhelmed by the simple improbability of it all. This is where the \"porn\" part of trauma porn comes in most for me. It definitely hits a gratuitous level of negativity at points.\n\nSome people really struggle with reading flawed characters, characters who make the kind of mistakes that the readers themselves would never forgive if they were on the receiving end of them. Some people are left feeling deeply unsatisfied if there doesn't feel like there's a moral to the story and/or a valuable perspective gained by the protagonist(s) through character development. If that describes you as a reader (and I don't at all mean this judgmentally) I highly doubt you'd enjoy reading this book.\n\nTrigger warnings. This book has SO MANY possible triggers for people. SA, domestic abuse, parental favoritism, childhood abandonment, pedophilia, self-harm/talk of suicide, and probably more I'm failing to mention. If you cannot read books with any of those topics presented (again, completely non-judgmentally) this book is absolutely not for you.\n\nLastly (and the most tame reason), while several of the characters do not come from money and are not well off financially, there's still a sort of pretentious hoity-toity aura to the characters because they're well-educated (from what appears to be a very prestigious American University, but it's never named) and basically all of their peers are cut from that same cloth. That, combined with the fact that many of them are in the professional arts of some sort, it's just a personality type that not everybody will enjoy reading. In fact I'd *almost* argue you'd have to have known/been close to at least one person who is similar to one (but hopefully several) of the characters in order to gravitate towards this book.\n\n**What I did like about this book**\n\nWhen I think of the phrase \"trauma porn\" I think about something where the traumatic events themselves are the things that keep me coming back, lusting for them in a \"fuck me up fam, make me want to curl into the fetal position and sob\" kind of way. But that's not what kept me coming back to reading this book. As I mentioned just above, it helps tremendously to have known characters in real life who are similar to those in this book. And I have absolutely been close to several people in my life (as well as directly relating to some of them as an individual) who these characters reminded me of, in both positive and negative ways. As such, I kept coming back to reading this book because these characters felt so *human* to me. In their ups and their downs, their rationale, while often deeply flawed, resonated very strongly and evoked a deep empathy within me for myriad reasons. I didn't keep coming back to get hurt, I kept coming back because I was interested in their stories.\n\nFor as aggressively upsetting as many aspects of this book were, there were some unbelievably heartwarming parts as well. The lowest lows helped emphasize the highest highs and vice versa. They ebbed and flowed throughout the book in such a way that kept me on my toes and encouraged me to keep going. I finished this book in 8 days, which means I averaged right about 100 pages per day, just shy of 38,000 words per day. But there were days I didn't read it at all, and days where I read twice that much. It was easy to just keep reading from a prose and continuity perspective.\n\nOn a basic level, these is obviously a catharsis which comes from the emotional release of a book like this if it hits right. And I can absolutely say that it hit right for me. I'm no stranger to crying while reading, but it's typically from moments of overwhelming joy, the cataclysmic relief of tension when something happy/joyous occurs. And that absolutely happened here, but it also went beyond that. This is the first book that has ever gotten me to cry over something that was heartbreakingly sad.\n\nIf you've never known somebody like Jude in your life, somebody who has such a punishingly negative opinion of their own self worth, this book probably won't feel very realistic to you. But as somebody who has spent time around people who view themselves in that harsh of a light, I think Yanagihara did a phenomenal job at capturing the essence of that kind of person's level of public masking and internal turmoil, of their utter unwillingness to believe that anything truly good can be happening to them, or that they somehow don't deserve those good things. It was painful to read, but it did feel authentic to that experience. And in addition to that, I think she really nailed the reactive elements of loved ones confronted with the realities that a person like Jude faces. Those also were painful to read for countless reasons, but once again authentic to the experience. Or at least, authentic to my own experience.\n\nI thought this was an incredibly well-done character study of a person who somehow managed to find some surface-level success despite society itself having failed him at absolutely every possible step on his way to adulthood, and the social elements that go along with it.",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 6 - The Lady or The Tiger by Frank Stockton Hehe it was hilarious story. I looked up some discussions of this one and it seems that this is a well analysed story. While most analyses focus on &gt;!love vs jealousy, here's my take on the book. The author, through this story, exposes the human bias where in people believe that *they* could do no wrong, but the *other* most definitely would. Especially one described as barbaric and jealous - because after all *we a*re well aware how those feelings affects us and what someone in that situation would do, essentially meaning that we ourselves might choose the *other's* choice of action, despite feeling assured that there's no way we would.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*I would rather starve than steal, but surely the poor wretch could bear his hunger no longer and resorted to stealing. I can understand, but I could never do the same, for I am better.*!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*This barbaric princess would surely throw the man to the tiger, but I would surely choose love, because I am better. The princess however, is barbaric after all. Besides we all know how jealously can drive you to murder. We all know that feeling intimately. But surely, given the power over someone's fate, I would choose better.*!&lt;\n\nEssentially it forces us to face ourselves. Not in the choice of love, trust or security. But rather in knowing what we are capable of, and then, knowing how barbaric our choice would be, and then choosing better because of that knowledge. Perhaps out of pride or dignity, or perhaps out of good sense and morality. To know your monsters is to tame them but many refuse to face this very reality. Therefore, this taunting story.\n\n  \nMy [Day 5 read](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pihzk3/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) here.

It has so much of emotions proportionately mixed that the overall story doesn't seem to be clichè. You can't blame any of the characters and feel sorry for all.

    "text": "Thoughts on how much we forgive unlikable protagonists? I’ve been noticing lately that I’ll happily follow certain unlikable or outright terrible protagonists for hundreds of pages, but in other books a character makes one mildly annoying choice and I’m immediately out. It made me wonder what actually tips the balance. Is it the writing, the character’s voice, the pacing, or just whether they’re “compelling” in some hard‑to-define way? The contrast hit me after finishing a novel where the main character was a complete disaster of a person, yet I couldn’t stop reading because the author made their spiral strangely fascinating. Then I picked up another book with a much milder “messy” lead and found myself getting irrationally irritated two chapters in. I’m trying to figure out what the difference was. Well, Curious how other people think about this. What makes you stick with (or give up on) an unlikable protagonist?",

Why is he giving us Orkideh’s perspective after she has died in the narrative? And on that note, how is the narrative perspective of any of these characters justified at all? The lack of any sort of justified narrative distance of any of the narrators (except for maybe Cyrus a little bit) is absolutely jarring for me. And why does it feel like every character is plucked straight from a cookie cutter version of a person? Almost no one felt super like able to me except for maybe Zee and even he felt more just like a narrative tool than a person. I have so many questions about specific things in the book that didn’t land for me. Nearly every time two characters were talking in this book it felt so forced and cringey. How did this get so many accolades?\n\nSorry I’m just needing to rant a little. Based on what I’ve seen most of you like this book but man it just didn’t cut it at all for me.

    "text": "Advice on how to approach continental philosophy (specifically Heidegger) Hello, everyone!\n\nI‘ve been wondering about this for some time and could really use some help. I‘m fairly new to philosophy and it’s a lot different from what I expected. My lifelong idea of philosophy (as a layperson) apparently lines up more with what‘s called analytic philosophy (of which I’ve only read one essay), with its emphasis on logic and systematic argumentation.\n\nI’ve only read some works of Sartre and Heidegger so far and I‘m honestly not sure how to approach them. I have enjoyed reading Heidegger despite the difficulty (I did have to lean a little bit on explainer videos), but **when I thought of challenging myself by writing a brief response essay, I hit a wall. I thought about it for a few days and realized that I enjoyed Heidegger like I enjoy poetry or a work of fiction, not as a rigorous argument that I could try to question or disprove or add to. Because how do I respond to claims like earth, sky, divinities, mortals are a fourfold which are stayed by the thing when it things (I’m sorry if I’m misremembering; it’s been a while)?** **These seem to me less like claims that can be argued with (I guess what I mean is falsifiable) than myth-making.** They’re lovely to read and imagine but I don’t understand how we’re supposed to take them any more seriously than a sustained myth or use them as tools to think about the world. I’ve been wanting to read Hubert Dreyfuss’s work on Heidegger and AI for a while, but now I’m thinking, how can we build robust arguments about something like this on top of what feels like a fanciful foundation?\n\nI apologize if any of this came across as disparaging. I’m not trying to imply that Heidegger or continental philosophy lacks rigor or value. **My goal here is to understand what I’m missing and see the possibilities that so many other people obviously can** (including analytic philosophers, many of whom have written on Heidegger).\n\n**If this is too broad, a specific question would be, how can I engage with an essay like The Thing? How do I go about responding to it? What questions should I be asking myself or the text?**",

    "text": "John Updike's Rabbit books Yesterday I bought all 4 of John Updike's Rabbit books at the library bookstore, as well as Licks of Love. Which has Rabbit Remembered. \n\nI do find the premise really interesting. Seeing America from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s from Rabbit and Updike's point of view. I've read many reviews of the series, and some love it, while others hate it. I do like how descriptive Updike makes the scenes- but he goes WAY too overboard with descriptiveness sometimes, to the point where it takes 10 pages to do what should be done in 1, and you just see these walls of text. There was a sex scene early on in the book, and it wasn't very good. It kind of feels like nihilistic historical fiction like Catcher in the Rye. Rabbit really isn't a great person, but I still like seeing the world from his point of view. \n\nI'm wondering if I should read these or just sell them as a set. Yesterday was the first time I even heard about the Rabbit books. It never really got major literary recognition, Rabbit Run was the only one to get a movie, and it is fairly difficult to read and understand what is going on. Some consider it as an important work of American cultural fiction, and other Redditors had to read the book as part of high school or college classes. My local library doesn't even carry the books. \n\nI do really like how Rabbit, Run transported me to 60s Pennsylvania, and really captures how this town feels. But besides descriptions of the scenery, there really isn't much there. The scenery and descriptions are great, but it doesn't feel like the characters are there to maintain my interest in the story.\n\nAnd please try to keep the thread about what YOU think about the Rabbit books. I don't want some lecture about how I should think. I don't want some lecture criticizing what I consider as important literature or what my library should carry. Keep this thread about what you think of the Rabbit books. If you've never read any of the Rabbit books, don't comment.",

    "text": "Just finished Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Octavia Butler was phenomenal - prophetic, really - in imagining the world of 2025 from 1993. Sure, some of the problems are more severe, a little more dystopic, but she was keyed into the right issues - climate, societal collapse, racism, etc.\n\nThis was a challenging novel to read because the setting is so dark. The struggle of the characters to survive is unrelenting. But the novel isn't simply about surviving, it's about the protagonist's attempt to sow something new in the midst of destruction. I don't know that I ever got fully on board Lauren Olamina's \"Earthseed\" religion and God as Change, but I still found encouragement and some lightness in how Lauren found companions and support through cooperation in the midst of a veritable Californian Mad Max world.\n\nOne of the few scifi elements in the book is Lauren's hyperempathy - as a result of her mother's drug abuse during pregnancy, Lauren is able to telepathically experience the sensations of other people - predominantly pain, but also pleasure, as little of it as there is in her life. I would have expected this to play more of a role in Earthseed, but it didn't seem to.\n\nI'll probably read a few other books in the interim, but I definitely want to pick up Parable of the Talents before long.",

I was really excited to read this book. It seemed interesting, and I was curious about the conditions and personalities that lead to atrocities. I quit in the third chapter because NONE OF IT IS PROPERLY RESEARCHED. O’Reilly made an accusation against king Henry VIII that didn’t seem right, and was in fact disproved by the shallowest google search possible. I then went to the book’s reference section. Of the 11 chapters most have less than 5 sources, and all these sources seem to be for things like newspaper articles and population data, not biographical information. His chapter on New Orleans slaver has ONE SOURCE. This could have been a really cool book, and it is instead a massive waste of time. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the library instead of paying good money for it. If you’re interested in nonfiction, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. (1840; nonfiction) In 1834, a Harvard undergraduate has to drop out of college in his junior year after an attack of measles affects his eyesight. Richard Henry Dana, Jr., decides that a good spell of sea air, hard work, and no studying would improve his health, so he signs on as a common sailor aboard the merchant ship *Pilgrim*, bound from Boston around the Horn and onward to California. \n\nIt’s an unusual decision for a young man of his class and prospects. Living in the forecastle in damp, cramped, dark, and smelly conditions, \"foremast jacks\" labored hard six or more days a week, often exposed to the worst weather; ate salt beef and hardtack; received little or no medical care; and had no say aboard ship. There the captain—no matter how unstable, unfair, or vicious—reigned with absolute authority, \"lord paramount\" as Dana calls him. \n\nWith a good captain, the system works despite its hardships, but under a bad one, sailors suffer. After Dana witnesses the unjust flogging of two men, he vows to someday \"do something to redress the grievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings, of whom I then was one,\" and this book marks one attempt to do that.\n\nDana is an attractive figure. Not brought up to manual labor and just recovering from an illness, he's nevertheless always game, ready to jump into the hardest work. At first he's exhausted after two hours of swabbing the deck, but he soon becomes strong and active, springing up into the rigging with the best of them. He's enterprising in other ways too, as when he teaches himself Spanish by borrowing a grammar and dictionary and listening closely to conversations. He also has an endearing interest in other people, and his passages describing them are some of the best in the book.\n\nMany readers will be entranced by the life-at-sea narrative, with its storms and floggings and men overboard, icebergs and whales, jib-booms and knight-heads and royal-yards. Surprisingly to me though, where Dana's account really takes off and becomes riveting is when he gets to the California coast. These chapters are packed with fascinating observations about the people, customs, trade, and geography.   \n  \nThis is California before the Gold Rush, before palm trees, when it was a foreign country: a backwater Mexican possession with little to trade beyond hides, horns, and tallow. Few towns boast more than a crumbling mission and presidio and a scattering of small one-story adobe houses. San Pedro and San Diego are even less developed, and San Francisco Bay is almost deserted.\n\nAs a Boston Yankee, Dana can hardly stand it. “In the hands of an enterprising people, what a country this might be!” He sees rich potential everywhere, often with great prescience, as when he says of San Francisco Bay:  \n\n\n&gt;If California ever becomes a prosperous country, this bay will be the centre of its prosperity. The abundance of wood and water, the extreme fertility of its shores, the excellence of its climate, which is as near to being perfect as any in the world, and its facilities for navigation, affording the best anchoring-grounds in the whole western coast of America, all fit it for a place of great importance. \n\nAn appendix to the book published 24 years after the 1840 original describes Dana’s return visit to San Francisco, now a bustling city, and everywhere he goes people quote this passage back to him. His was the only existing account of northern California, found in many a prospector's back pocket.\n\nAlthough he calls Spanish Californians idle and thriftless, Dana doesn't automatically dislike foreigners. He gives the Spanish credit where he feels it's due. He has nothing but praise for the Hawaiians, called Sandwich Islanders or their own name for themselves, Kanaka, in the book. They crew ships all around the Pacific, and some also have temporary work at the hide-houses where Dana spends several months working on shore. Of these men, he writes:  \n\n\n&gt;They were the most interesting, intelligent, and kind-hearted people that I ever fell in with. I felt a positive attachment for almost all of them; and many of them I have, to this time, a feeling for, which would lead me to go a great way for the mere pleasure of seeing them, and which will always make me feel a strong interest in the mere name of a Sandwich Islander.\n\nHe thinks very highly of their character as well, and becomes a sort of blood-brother to one of the Hawaiians.  \n\nThe book is full of interesting observations on the manners, customs, clothes, food, appearance, houses, and entertainments of the various sets of people in California, and fascinating glimpses into a lost world:  \n\n\n&gt;Horses are the cheapest thing in California; the very best not being worth more than ten dollars apiece, and very good ones being often sold for three, and four. In taking a day's ride, you pay for the use of the saddle, and for the labor and trouble of catching the horses. If you bring the saddle back safe, they care but little what becomes of the horse.\n\nThough the above passage is the sort of thing I love Dana for, the book does have plenty of exciting sea stuff, especially a harrowing return trip round the Horn. Patrick O'Brian drew upon Dana's account, and fans of the Aubrey-Maturin series may find some interesting parallels, especially the naturalist Professor Nuttall, who much like Stephen Maturin expresses great disappointment with the ship's captain refuses to stop at an uninhabited island, in the middle of difficult ship maneuvers, so he can do some botanizing.\n\nAll in all, Dana’s memoir is entertaining and fascinating as hell. Can’t recommend enough.",

I generally like reading older novels, set in pre-internet/digital technology age, so as I’ve had to read more modern books, I always find it interesting when they include things smartphones and texting and social media, to see how they add to the story. I also like fiction about books (readers, bookshops, libraries) too, and it sort of just occurred to me, that I’ve never come across a book where a character was listening to an audiobook, which would be something kind of commonplace now.\n\nHas anyone ever come across a book where a character was listening to an audiobook? If so, which one? Was it just a minor detail, i.e. to set the scene, or was it more significant?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the replies! I especially love the personal experiences about books on tape when they were CDs/cassettes!",

    "text": "Returned to Tolkien after years Today, after years and years, I returned to reread the Lord of the Rings. I have now only read the first chapter, but I almost feel like both laughing and crying.\n\nI first read the trilogy as a 12-14 year-old, can't remember exactly when. Then later in a second time (with merely skimming some parts) in high school. After that, haven't read it, though I started a couple of times but never went through with it.\n\nSo now, today, I felt the time had come, opened the first book. As I said, I've only read the first chapter so far, but: for one, I feel like returning to a long-lost friend, like finding again a comfortable corner in an old, cosy room, a place of which I did, in fact, have memory. I feel like I reconnected with something long-forgotten and something well-missed and loved. Second: I had forgotten how clever and genuinely funny Tolkien's writing is. I'm sure the tone changes once events set on the darker paths, but still, I didn't remember how playful, even, at least the beginning of the book is. And how wonderfully the writing in general flows. Like a Prancing Pony of sorts, in text form. Third: returning to the small to massive events of the story, the characters, the world in general, hits different now, as a thirty-something. I can't wait to dive deeper into this masterpiece, with, it feels, new eyes and heart. I almost feel like I'm reading the book for the first time, while simultaneously knowing the plot. Somehow this makes it even better.\n\nI have read the Hobbit, obviously, but no other Tolkien's works (aside LOTR). I habe recently acquired Silmarillion and Fall of Gondoling, and I already can't wait to read those!\n\n  \nHabe you had similar experiences with Tolkien or other writers or works? Or, perhaps, experiences entirely different when you returned to a literary work years later? What about concerning LOTR specifically?",

    "text": "Why you should read The Count of Monte Cristo What I am about to write probably FEELS like a spoiler but it really isn't. Think of this as a contextual nudge so you can just hop on the ride and enjoy the twists and turns yet to come that leave your jaw on the GROUND.\n\nOkay so long story short: it is the longest book that you never want to end and perhaps the greatest revenge story ever told. The first 100 pages have the narration putting the reader ''in the know''. What that means is YOU see more than Dante than does. And what you see is an innocent young man get his life ***completely destroyed*** without having done anything to deserve it. Like, literally nothing. Nada. Zilch.  It's almost comical in how petty it is. He's thrown in prison with NO idea why but you do.\n\nThen the narration FLIPS after a couple of hundred pages... suddenly Dante knows more than YOU do as the reader and it remains that way for the rest of the book. He's out of prison. He knows who did this. He knows who destroyed him. And it is payback time. And, you, my dear reader are just there for the ride and what a ride is!\n\nA lot of people get put off by the length which is a shame but I think people should go in with this as the bare minimum when scared of its length. The book is a ROLLERCOASTER and justifies every page it has.\n\n# Quick Note: (edit)\n\nPenguin English Classic edition is the one you want. There are many translations and controversy surrounding them. That's one of the best.\n\n\n\n# Edit 2:\n\nFor those of you have read it, please remember not to spoil for the new readers I am trying to promote the book to. Most people are being respectful of this but some are not. Please may we be considerate?",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 5 - \"A Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov A delightful read! Fun, hilarious and familiar. Considering the difficulties I faced when reading \"The Lady with the Dog\", I'd say this story was a breeze. And not for the writing, which doesn't seem to be easier in any way, but perhaps because the setting is simpler to follow. The crux of the story too, is relatable enough, that even modern day stand-ups exist on this topic.\n\nThe theme of the story is timeless, infinite, and captures the very nature of life - it's duality. From the title you may guess that it is a story about chameleon-like behavior of a person with questionable morals. The story excellently captures the ordinary, making it a classic and setting it apart. You might as well be reminded of an​ occurrence just earlier this week or month in your life, while reading about this two-toned opportunist and the makeshift conference formed of people crowding about a sudden activity.\n\n&gt;!The story mentions a character as red haired. Is this information important and conveys something? Or is it simply a little tidbit of characterization?!&lt;\n\nThank you as always, for the support and discussions.

    "text": "On Bullshit by Harry G. Frankfurt This one is so short, it really qualifies as an essay. But, one edition is between two covers, so I guess it counts as a book.\n\nI snagged it from my local library because of Modern Day Oracles or Bullshit Machines and Calling Bullshit courses by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin D. West, University of Washington. I figured some background wouldn’t hurt and might help me. I found it didn’t help as much as I’d hoped, but I was still entertained.\n\nWhat’s it about? Frankfurt tries (successfully) to define bullshit (rather academically). In short, a bullshit artist is solely focused on persuasion and making an impression, not caring about truth. Paradoxically, bullshit can be true. \n\nWhat makes it bullshit is how it is created - shoddily, hastily and without regard for fine work. A gifted liar does their thing carefully so that the truth cannot be found out. A bullshit artist just flings it out, overwhelming skepticism with sheer volume, until something sticks with the audience. \n\nNow the downside is that **On Bullshit** is written in a dry academic form, citing references, historical uses and changes over time. Not very exciting reading. But it does build up for Frankfurt’s final stinger and one that does get you to think. It’s also proof that there is a sense of humor lurking in the mind that wrote **On Bullshit**. But it’s not bullshit. \n\n7 out of 10. ★★★★★★★",

    "text": "Is The Poisonwood Bible an allegory about US foreign policy in the 1960s? In sending missionary Reverend Nathan Price to Congo, America did not send its best and brightest.  \n\nFrom not listening to the natives who are trying to help (Mama Tataba warning Nathan about the poisonwood tree, and replanting the garden), the unconscious arrogance of assuming that what works in America will likewise work overseas (Nathan and Leah planting seeds from the US, instead of planting fruits and vegetables native to the region, and also reversing Mama Tataba's work in said garden), Nathan's disrespect of local customs (the diatribe against nakedness), steamrolling a policy over the objections of the community (his single-minded obsession with river baptism, when the Congolese keep their children away from the river after a crocodile killed a girl), ignoring the warnings from people who have been their longer and are more familiar with Congo (The Underdowns informing Price that Belgium will evacuate Leopoldville and the Prices should also leave)...\n\nIn the character of Nathan Price, I see America's experience in Vietnam writ large.\n\nAnd lest you think that the Reverend will bring his flock to Jesus with love and compassion, think again.  Reverend Price's God is from the Old Testament.  His is a wrathful, vengeful, harsh god.  His sermons burst with hellfire and damnation, sin and punishment.  The log in his eye blinds him to how he alienates the Congolese with his every action.  The more I read, the more I am convinced that Price's parishioners in Georgia tithed and donated just to get him away from them.\n\nMaybe it's an indictment of colonialism in general.  Either way, it's a fascinating read.  Unlike some books where authors throw in foreign words now and then to let you know the setting, I feel immersed in 1960s Congo.  And knowing what I do about Patrice Lumumba, the CIA, and the Belgian evacuation from the Congo, I shudder to think what is in store for the Prices--and if there is anything that can shake Nathan Price from his arrogant, intolerant, judgmental certainty that he is doing God's will.",

I was so angry at Elliot for just rolling over and letting his wife make this ridiculous request of him, especially when she said “he is the one with the decision to make.”  That was just so wildly manipulative and she treated him so horribly throughout the entire book. I don’t feel like the author did much or anything to make Claire sympathetic at all, and j am wondering if that because….she isn’t and wasn’t meant to be? Or because the book was so devoted to Elliot’s point of view? \n\nIt was such a vivid illustration of the loneliness epidemic that men are in and how it really leaves men with few good options when they really need support.",

I'm thinking about this right now as I read Kristin Hannah's *The Women*, where she doesn't seem to know that San Diego and Los Angeles are distinct cities that are a few hours' drive from each other. But it comes up all the time in books, even quite good books. For example, reading the *Game of Thrones* series, it felt like people were just zipping up and down Westeros at a moment's notice despite worldbuilding implying that these places are quite far from each other.\n\nAre there books where the author does a great job of making the geography of their world -- whether real or fictional, contemporary or historical -- feel realistic? Or the converse, can you think of a book with a laughably bad sense of internal geography?\n\nI'm leaving nonfiction books out of this, since presumably the people who write them have the actual facts of how space and distance works in their setting.",

    "text": "Getting back into reading, one short story a day, Day 4 - \"The Cop and The Anthem\" by O Henry The twists and ironies so classic to O Henry, in this story, brings a wry smile to the face. O Henry has written a variety of short stories, many of which I've had the pleasure of reading since childhood. This one, The Cop and The Anthem, is as humorous as it is satirical, a touch poignant, and a touch allegorical. I find the use of language extremely easy to read and follow, there isn't really any particularly deep setting to get lost in, but still enough of it to build a stage, a scene, where a theatrical act, perhaps a mime, is carried out in written words by the author. Adding to that, the imagery and the personification and other literary devices used to describe the house of All Outdoors is such a treat - fun and marvelous at the same time. \n\n&gt;!The story follows a man planning his survival strategy for the harsh winter, and how he cops out of a responsible way of living. The cop in the title is both literal and figurative and so is the anthem. We may not all be homeless fellas looking to survive the winter through unconventional means, but we've all had that moment of revelation in our lives, where everything seemed born anew, our motivation and inspiration tingling our senses, urging us to embrace our new life, before reality and familiarity offers or forces upon us, a cop out. I also found it funny how no one would arrest our man for petty crimes, but a homeless man with ambition in his eyes? Says he's doing nothin' on top of that? Why come along!, the policeman says. Sad, hilarious but sad. And isn't it the same for us? Looked down upon with familiarity while we struggle but the moment we decide to rise up, even before we can act, in the momentary nothing of the decision bearing upon us, we are immediately policed into old habits. !&lt;\n\n  \nMy [Day 3 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pgveoe/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) had such engaging responses, the author's works well read and discussed!

Hill has finally followed in his dad's footsteps and produced his own magnum opus.  This 850-pager sprawls over decades and follows a group of friends who, through some arcane processes, bring a dragon into the world...that demands regular sacrifices.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it.  When the storytelling seems like it slows down WHOMP we're put right into the middle of a car chase.  When there's not enough mystery, suddenly we introduce more elements in a bit of a magic quest.  King-like heartbreak?  Yep, that's in there too.  Although I put a spoiler tag on this, that's more for the comments - I don't enjoy spoiling it for anyone.  I will say that there are a few Stephen King Easter eggs in here, but that Hill stands on his own.",

The mix of various types of horror like supernatural and internal struggles, romance, shared traumatic experiences, shared vulnerability, and beating unlikely odds was amazing.\n\nWhen reading the summary on the inside front of the jacket and the little bit of text on the back cover, I got a suspicion that there would be some romance, but it took up a large part of the book (which I did not see coming) and I'm totally shocked by how much I enjoyed it, and I can't pin point why I did. My bookshelf is almost exclusively horror related works and I've never had any interest in romance literature. At points, I found myself rooting more for the success and mending of the relationship between the two main characters, more than the defeat of the supernatural evil. Plus the romance was not sexual which I appreciate (yes I'm ok with blood and gore but not sex call me weird I don't care).\n\nI felt like I could connect to the main character  (Andrew) in a way I've never been able to in any other book.\n\nSpoilers ahead\n\nThe reveal about Dove was so interesting because if you think about it, Andrew was the only person she interacted with. The ending wasn't completely clear to me, which may have been intentional. Did Thomas die? Did Thomas and Andrew die? The way I interpreted it was Andrew cut out Thomas' heart and then Thomas' body died but both of thier souls shared Andrew's heart (and body too I suppose). Something else I didn't get was, so was it the stories creating the monster the entire time or was it the drawings? It seemed like the former but they still wanted to destroy the drawings?\n\nI'm giving Don't let the forest in by CG Drews a light 9.\n\nI hope someone will read this explosion of words and share my sentiment.",

    "text": "Harass me for tickets, I will sell them instead I bought tickets to a really desirable concert with my cousin for $200 each back in February.  I’ve been looking forward to this concert all year.  A couple weeks ago my cousin told me she couldn’t go anymore and I can keep her ticket and invite a friend.  Even though she paid $200 for her ticket already, she said she didn’t want her money back that any friend I invite can go for free.\n\nI invite a friend of mine to go with me and she says yes.  She’s excited she can go and is grateful she got the ticket for free.\n\nThe day of the concert is coming up in four days and she texts me to let me know it’s forecast to snow the day of the concert and it will be super cold and windy with wind chills down to zero.  I check weather apps and decide to listen to the local news forecast on tv.  It doesn’t look good.\n\nI tell my friend that I don’t drive in the snow and can’t really take the train because the outdoor temp will be so low and in my area I sometimes have to wait for the train outside for 20 minutes or so and don’t feel comfortable being exposed to the cold for that long.  I also can’t Uber to the stadium because roundtrip would be too expensive.  I tell her if the weather is bad that day, I will just transfer the tickets to her and she can go without me.\n\nShe starts pressuring me to let her know ahead of time so she is “not scrambling at the last minute.”  I told her that snow and weather predictions are pretty variable in our area and I can’t really decide until the day of when I get a feel for how much snow has fallen (it is supposed to fall overnight) and see the condition of the roads and how bad the wind and the wind chill is.\n\nShe lives very close to the venue so it will be easy for her to get there, even if the weather is bad.  She again says that the right thing to do is to let her know a couple days ahead of time so she can find someone else to go with.  It’s making me uncomfortable that she’s already planning to go with someone else before the snow even hits the ground.  She has a friend she usually goes to concerts with who also lives near her so I knew in her beady little brain that she is planning a concert outing with her other friend and just wants me to transfer the tickets now instead of waiting for the actual weather event.\n\nI think about it for a minute.  I tell her that I’ve decided ahead of time since the weather will be bad, to list my tickets for resale and try to get my money back since I can’t go.\n\nShe responds with, “Wow.”\n\nI replied:  “Oh did you just expect me to transfer $400 worth of tickets to you before the snow even hits the ground?  Or do you want to buy the tickets yourself?”\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\nEven if the tickets don’t sell, I’m not giving them to her anyway.\n\nUpdate:  my friend texted me this morning and offered $200 for both tickets since my cousin already said she could have the other one free.\n\nI responded: “Wow that’s so nice of you.  A real friend would invite me to stay over in case of bad weather so I wouldn’t miss this once in a lifetime concert experience.  That’s what my cousin would have done as she also lives nearby.”\n\nI told you guys she was already planning on taking someone else!!  Nope, nope, nope.\n\nUpdate #2:  if she is willing to fork over $200 then why not offer to pay for my Uber costs which would be $150 roundtrip or offer to pay for a hotel if she doesn’t want me in her house?  It’s all fishy to me anyway.\n\nUpdate #3:  my tickets sold for full price so now I have $400 and can give my cousin her money back!",

    "text": "Gaslight me at my job? Ok well I won't always work here... Years ago I worked for a small nonprofit with a great mission. It helped a lot of people, but the office environment was toxic AF. I worked there for six months and was gaslit like crazy. There were lots of small petty day-to-day things, but the piece de resistance happened toward the end of my tenure: I made a mistake with something public-facing, which I fully owned up to and apologized profusely for. They could've (and probably should’ve) fired me with cause for this mistake, but... they didn't. I was told that everything was fine, nothing further needed to happen, and to please be conscientious moving forward. I won't lie, I was surprised, but these guys were so in my head at that point I had this idea I should stick it out and prove myself at this job, so I took them at their word.\nThe next day, suddenly my main responsibility was delegated to someone else. So, everything's not fine? \"Nope! What are you talking about? Everything's normal!\" \"Am I getting new responsibilities?\" \"No just stick with what you're doing!\" You mean, half of what I used to do? Ok.... \n\nThe following week a coworker asked if I was coming to the holiday party, I said no, I was contract-to-hire and had been told by my manager so sorry, the party was full-time/salaried only. Whatever. Two days later the CEO's assistant emailed saying \"we never got your RSVP to the holiday party!\" So…my manager lied? Hurtful and rage-inducing, but at that point I didn't want to go anyway, so I informed them I was not able to attend. Ok....\n\nThe office closed for the holidays, and immediately after the new year I went in as normal, and was almost immediately called into a meeting. You can guess where this was going: Apparently due to budgetary concerns my position had been eliminated and they had to lay me off. What else could I say but: Ok... I collected references from the not-crappy people, packed up my stuff, went home, and destroyed the company mug they gave me on my first day with a hammer for some catharsis. \n\nSix weeks later I checked the company website while compiling my work history, and shocker: they had a new employee with a suspiciously-similar-but-legally-distinct job title, and responsibilities that were identical to mine! By that point I was well and truly out of fucks to give about that place, and was knee-deep in funemployment, but I filed that tidbit away as a good reminder of how shitty that place was to me.\n\nFast-forward several years: I was well-established in a much better job at a very well-respected company full of excellent people! I liked the org so much I volunteered on an internal committee led by my friend Michael, and we would partner with local orgs and nonprofits to help with community improvement and advocacy. While discussing potential orgs to partner with at our annual meeting, Michael mentioned the name of my old nonprofit! He said that there had been some preliminary conversations with the org about potential opportunities, and that it seemed like a good fit! So…after the meeting I hung back and I asked Michael if we could talk for a few minutes.\n\nI laid out every bit of two-faced nonsense that had happened to me there, and since Michael and I were friends I did not spare any details. Michael also happened to be very high up in HR! He had a…shall we say unique perspective on just how shitty the nonprofit was to me? That, perhaps, it was an indication that they were probably doing things I didn’t know about that were even shittier?\n\nWelp, after our discussion, Michael reached out to the nonprofit and let them know we wouldn’t move forward with a partnership, then he put the nonprofit on our company’s blacklist. They don’t know I was involved, or that by not treating me better when I was an employee, they missed out on a HUGE opportunity. Last I heard, they’re in a near-constant state of circling the drain. Meanwhile I’m up for a promotion. Living well is definitely the best revenge.\n\nEDIT for clarification: Several people pointed out I was bad at my job and should've gotten fired. You're right, as I said I should have gotten fired. But that wasn't discussed, nor was an improvement plan. Instead, the nonprofit told me all was forgiven, no worries, just do better, and convinced me to stay at my job. Then they spent weeks messing with me and my responsibilities before \"letting me go\" at the start of a new fiscal year.",

    "text": "Give me a slow laptop coz I am a consultant - expect slower throughput So this happened more than a decade ago when I worked as a consultant to a major pharma company. Now to be fair they were great people nice working culture etc very friendly relations between the pharma company devs and our devs. All great. Great WFH policy (in fact all us consultants worked remotely).\n\n\n\nEverything except ONE thing. We all had laptops (shipped to the consultants) with very heavy software running on it and it was both CPU and Memory intensive. Again totally fair. As developers our job was to run these to locally run the code and develop it, modify it etc. One \\*BIG\\* difference. The regular employees got really great fast high speed machines. As \"Consultants\" we got the lower end ones, despite all of us having to debug and update the same code!\n\n  \nWe brought this up to our team leads/managers/VP and to their higher-ups that \"hey our overall throughput would be significantly higher and your own cost would go down if our laptops could run these local servers faster\". The employee developers and teams leads also helped us make that same case.\n\n  \nAverage laptop cost is say $1500 for a high end (at the time). Average cost of the lower end one say $800. So a difference of $700 per consultant (times say 10 consultants) would have brought the total cost to say $7K. Total amount of extra HOURS we billed them due to this MUCH MUCH higher.\n\n  \nBut of course the bean counters at the parent company said, \"no way in hell are we giving the lowly consultants the best machines\". Add to that our main business point of contact was a real piece or work and pushed back \\*just as vehemently\\*. After lots of pleading arguing etc, we gave up. Now our strategy was simple. We'd simply get less work done in the day. To give everyone an idea of how this works. Each time you change a line of code and save. To recompile + restart the server locally it would easily take 10 mins on our consultant laptops (as opposed to just 3 mins on the employee laptops). We would deliberately make it compile multiple times. When the employee business team complained we'd screen-share and show them each time they complained, how long it took for even minor changes.\n\n  \nFunny thing was the consultants were all remote so we'd put the code to compile and go have coffee or do household chores lol. Their POS business contact tried to crack the whip on us, we said \"hey there really IS no way for us to go quicker without quicker laptops\". After 6 months of them falling behind on projects AND being over billed due to to more hours being spent, they FINALLY woke up from their slumber and upgraded our laptops to bring them in line with the employee ones!\n\n  \nOf course 2 months after we got better laptops I found a much better job and left. Still reminisce about those long coffee breaks though! ;-) Funniest part was when I called their helpdesk once. The agent quite literally admitted. \"You know I have worked here for 10 years now and I'll NEVER understand why the Directors and VPs need top of the line laptops when all they they run is word excel and powerpoint and meanwhile the ones actually doing the heavy computing get 5 year old laptops\". Amusing anecdote lol",

    "text": "Finally stood up for someone who needed it Back in high school, I had this friend who always got picked on. She was quiet and kept to herself, and for some reason that made her a magnet for this one girl who acted like the queen of the hallway. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just constant little digs that added up. The kind that made you feel bad even when nobody else noticed.\n\nI remember seeing it happen a lot and just feeling useless. I wanted to say something, but I didn’t know how to do it without making it worse for her. So I stayed quiet, which honestly still annoys me when I think about it.\n\nFast forward to now. My friend and I were having coffee the other day, just talking about work and life, when that same girl from high school walked in. She looked exactly the same attitude and all.\n\nShe spotted my friend right away and said, loud enough for people to turn their heads, “Wow, you still look the same. Always so....plain.” then she looked at her from head to toe.\n\nI swear, something in my eye twitched. I just looked at her and said, “Yeah, she looks the same. Stable job, good life, no issues. What’s your situation now? Still starting drama for fun?”\n\nThe whole place went quiet for a second. She did this awkward laugh, like she was trying to pretend it didn’t bother her.\n\nThen she goes, “You’re being sensitive.”\n\nI told her, “If you’re still picking on people as an adult, that’s not being confident. That’s just sad. Anyway, we’re trying to enjoy our coffee. You can go.”\n\nShe didn’t even try to fire back. She just walked out, and honestly it was the most satisfying exit I’ve ever seen.\n\nMy friend looked at me after a few seconds and said, very quietly, “Thank you. I wish someone said something back then.”\n\nAnd yeah… I wish I did too. But at least I finally did now.\n\nps: I haven't seen that bully since. Maybe destiny is avoiding our paths getting crossed again because someone will definitely get cooked lol",

    "text": "Before I quit my job back in August, I forgot I did something petty and net nanny'd the workstations This just got brought up to me via text from one of my old coworkers and I had completely forgotten about it and thought I'd share it. For context, I live in the Midwest.\n\nI had a friend at my previous job, who worked in IT. He was head of Cybersecurity and licenses, while I was project manager for the site and ran the facilities. He and I had to work hand in hand frequently, as we had government contracts and had to log in visitors and get them vetted sometimes, for a key fob to enter the facility. I would collect vendor information and pass it onto him, while he ran things and got permissions. Sometimes, I was upgrading onsite systems or installing new equipment for monitoring things like the new solar panels and what not. \n\nThis required me to install new programs to not only my computer but specific workstations as well. Prior to this current job, I had worked for the government as a contractor and my top secret clearance was a good selling point for me with this company, as it meant the IT department could work with me on things and use my own contacts I'd also established. I was also the IT Manager and understood the lingo and nomenclature, so needless to say, my friend and I worked well with each other.\n\nUnlike any other IT department I'd worked with or companies I worked for, this job HATED I.T. and treated them like the red headed stepchild. IT hindered production and they hated all the rules and procedures that came from them. More like a burden, than preventive. The company gave them the lowest miniscule budget I'd ever seen and never took any of what they said seriously. They overworked them and made them come in on weekends or stay late, citing \"that's why they're salary.\" \n\nI sympathized with them and tried my best to help or do the work for them, to take things off their plate. New Access Point needed installed? No problem, I'll use the scissors lift to do it. Need the Ethernet cable ran 100 yards from the roof to the hub? Sure why not. The trust, my helping and knowledge lead to my friend giving me admin access, for me to install or debug programs for him while he was stuck in hours long training sessions or meetings. The company wisely had certain workstations committed to one computer and if that crashed or acted up, it shut down production or the line. It was just easier for me to enter in administrator credentials and reboot systems or troubleshoot, rather than wait for them to get done by IT.\n\nMy friend left for another job across the country and I honestly had forgotten that I had administrator credentials. I hadn't honestly needed them for a while and I was busy with other things. Because I was in charge of the facilities, I was generally the last one out every single day. The workers had a bad habit of leaving every light on and the owner of the company would get triggered by it. It was just easier for me to stay 20 mins after the end of my shift and close up shop, after the stragglers or people finishing jobs. My last day wasn't any different than normal but with one small difference... I heard voices this time while I was closing up.\n\nI followed the source and one of the workstations was left unlocked and blaring on his webpage, Fox News on one page and Newsmax on the other.  Employees had been warned about this tons and the person who's station I was at, was a shit person to me. An evil idea came over me and then I remembered that I had administrator credentials. I went to the web settings and started blocking those sites. Out of curiosity, I went to another workstation and found their browsing history was the same. So I proceeded to do the same thing. I continued to do this at every workstation throughout only one plant. Not only was it foolproof but the stations were unlocked by the username of the department it was at but also a blanket work password. \n\nThe administrator credentials were also a blanket username and password, not tied to anyone. Keycards were only logged in the system for INBOUND, not outbound. It wasn't unheard of for staff to still be there finishing things up, hence my staying late, so you couldn't pinpoint who dun it. The timestamp for admin access might give it away but there's no cameras on the facility, IT is generally one of the last ones out as well. They could check the logs all they wanted, it was a different team than when my friend was there and they didn't know I had admin access, hell even I forgot I did too. Plus I was quitting. Good luck proving it wasn't one of you OR admitting there was a breach in security.\n\nI honestly forgot about it until one of my the plant managers messaged me out of the blue today. We had a snow storm last night and the solar panels were acting up and they needed to know how to reboot them. I told him how cuz I was helping HIM, not the company. So we started catching up and I asked how the skeleton shift was working for them. He said fine but they'd been trying to fight a \"glitch in the Matrix\" for a few months now. The weekend crew was hit with layoffs cuz of the winter and these tariffs. They're running a crew of 3 on the weekends and they've been doing ok but their chief complaint is they can't \"use certain websites\" for some reason. \n\nSince IT was overworked and it was just the weekend shift complaining, it was deemed a low priority but apparently it's starting to piss more and more people off and they're now unintentionally throwing themselves under the bus if they're complaining they can't watch Fox News(etc) on shift INSTEAD of working. Seems like a win win to me.\n\nTLDR:\nI had admin access and blocked all the right wing websites prior to quitting my job. Now if someone complains about it, they'll admit that they're not paying attention to their job and get in trouble.",

Every year, the students in the honors music classes put on a concert for teachers and parents.

My band teacher is problematic, to say the least. He has a short temper and I don’t think he really wanted to be a teacher if I’m being honest. He got mad at us in class one day and blew up at us, saying stuff like how we were hopeless and had no talent (not true, in case you were wondering). So we got plotting.\n\nMy friends L and N and I had the idea of rickrolling the audience, so we got composing. Basically we started off playing some traditional band piece, then the music stopped and the tenor sax played the intro to “Never Gonna Give You Up,” and it went from their. It. Was. Epic.

I also recorded with my phone because my camera got accidentally disconnected and I knew she was going to end up hitting somebody.

Here's the bigger problem because she parked not just once but twice in the same spot where she got stuck again. She hit the same car two days in a row.

I reckon in the last year 15/40 hours a week were spent doing absolutely nothing. Accumulatively I must have racked up close to 2000 hours doing absolutely nothing in a 4 year period.

Said they’d have it picked up within a few weeks when they got settled.\n\nFlash forward a year later and multiple attempts to make them get their stuff. Kept getting the run around so I finally said “30 days and I’m getting rid of it”. Fwiw this was not super important stuff, I wasn’t holding onto heirlooms or Pawpaw’s ashes or anything lol.\n\nThe last week of the 30 days, their brother calls and makes arrangements to get everything. I was annoyed that it took my threats and a year to get this resolved and was feeling kinda petty at this point. One of the items was a pinball machine (it actually was pretty cool), so I removed all the pinballs from it. They’re cheap and easy to replace, but I know the moment they went to play the game and realized they couldn’t was glorious. Goes without saying I don’t talk to that person anymore!",

    "text": "Our entire neighborhood got petty revenge against our terrible landlord TL:DR Our landlords bullied us into moving out, and then screwed us out of thousands of dollars. Now the entire neighborhood works to make sure they can't get new tenants and the house sits empty. So far they've lost out on nearly $50,000 of potential rent because of how long the unit has sat empty.  \n  \nIn 2020 my family moved to a new state for my husband’s job. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and renting costs were way down across the country, so we didn’t think twice when we found a cute little house that fit our needs and was well within our budget range. 2 houses down from the school my kids would be attending and across the street from a really nice park. The house had been empty for a while – we assumed due to the pandemic – and the landlord, who was also the owner, seemed eager to get it rented. We had a friend walk through the house for us on a video call before we signed the contract, and everything seemed like it would work out.\n\nAs soon as we moved in, things started falling apart. The blinds fell off the window the first time I tried to adjust them. The plumbing under 2 different sinks started leaking within the first week. The seal on one of the toilets broke during the first month. We called the landlord who came over and fixed everything on his own – but always asked that my husband help him (My hubby used to work construction, and the landlord wasn’t too great with home repairs). Then during the second month we lived there, the garbage disposal broke. When I informed the landlords, they responded saying that they could come fix it, but that they would need to charge me a $70 service fee for repairs “as per the contract” and then pointed out that they should have charged me a service fee for each separate repair they had already made, but they were trying to be nice since we just moved in. I was confused – In every place we have ever rented, basic home wear and tear was NOT the tenants responsibility. That’s the entire reason we rent! I read back over the contract and realized that the line including a service fee for repairs doesn’t specify for repairs due to misuse of tenant – just repairs in general. I argued with them that it was THEIR home and they were responsible for basic repairs, but they insisted that I “kindly follow the contract”. I got in touch with other landlords in the area and they all agreed that my landlords were correct. Because most of the developed housing in this area is between 50-100 years old, landlords know that basic wear and tear will cost them an arm and a leg every time something breaks, so they implement a fee to discourage tenants calling about every little thing that might break. But I wasn’t calling because a door came loose off the hinges or a drawer fell off the track, I’m calling because water is pouring from under the toilet or appliances have shorted out, none of which is my fault. Regardless, we were stuck paying a service fee every time the landlord had to come fix something, which ended up being at least twice a month throughout the entire duration or our 2-year lease. Every time I had to call about an issue, they found a way to make it sound like the problem occurred because of our misuse.\n\nBecause I had argued with them about the terms of the contract and insisted that these damages were NOT due to misuse, they decided we must be incompetent, and began micromanaging EVERYTHING. A few things they did:\n\n·       Came over to supervise my husband as he fertilized and mowed the lawn to make sure that he was doing it correctly.\n\n·       Drive by at least once a week to see that the grass was mowed, leaves were raked, snow shoveled, flower beds weeded, etc… and would message us if they felt we had neglected it even a little bit – we did NOT live in an HOA neighborhood. They always ended with their messages with “If it’s too much for you to handle, we can do it for you, but we would have to charge you a weekly fee”. Yeah right, over my dead body!\n\n·       Find “hazards” to nitpick every time they came into the house – the rug was a tripping hazard - you can’t put those boxes there, they block the walkway and it’s a hazard – you have to secure your trampoline to the ground because it might be a hazard – you have to take out the edging that you put around the flowerbed, someone might trip into it, and it’s a hazard. To say I hated these people is an understatement.\n\n·       Call us on holidays to harass us about menial issues, such as the last time we weeded the yard or fertilized. Then they insisted on receipts and proof, and implied that we were lying because they said the entire yard looked unsatisfactory. To be clear, my husband dedicated 4 hours every Saturday to the landscaping of this sucky 1/3 acre lot, and it was the nicest looking lawn and yard on the block\n\nWhenever we would call about repairs that we weren’t comfortable handling ourselves, they would give us instructions like we were children. They would tell us what repair tools to purchase and how to fix it, even if we weren't comfortable with it. They insisted we try to manage it first before they came and looked at it, even if it was an electrical issue or plumbing issue that would require us to make changes to the house (which was prohibited in our contract). At first, we played their game, but when the instructions they gave us didn’t work, they would always respond with “well you probably did it wrong, but I can come look at it for you. I’ll have to charge you a service fee though. Or you can just call a professional”. Another option they gave was that they could come observe us attempting to fix it, and give instructions as we go, but if they had to condescend to physically touch the issue or repairs at all, that they would have to charge us a service fee. I really hated these people.\n\nAfter arguing the first time this happened about how unfair it was to charge me a fee after I just spent a lot my own time and money attempting to fix it per their instructions without any success, I told them to forget it, I would just call a professional. They took offense to that, and told us that they had to approve any professional we called to fix the problem. If we wanted a pro to look at it, WE had to do the research and send the landlord a proposal about who to use, and they would make the final determination – and we would still pay a service fee because the repair had to be made regardless if a pro fixed it or if they fixed it themselves. On 3 different occasions we had a professional come out to give a quote – each time for a different issue. Every time, the professionals refused to even bother with a quote for the specific issue they were called on because it was always a smaller part of a larger problem that would require extensive remodeling and repairs to do it correctly and ensure the problem was fully resolved. These were for structural issues of the home, such as the foundation being poured incorrectly (which was very evident in the way the plumbing exited the basement) or the wiring being done wrong causing a fire hazard. Due to insurance issues, any professional would be unable to only address the immediate problem without making extensive repairs. EVERY TIME, the landlord would say he wanted a second opinion and then bring in a “handyman friend” who looked at it and said that they pro’s were trying to scam him, that it was an easy fix, and that they could MacGyver a solution without spending thousands of dollars. Each time their fix would only last a few months, and then the problem would occur again and they would come back and figure out another half-baked solution – for which we had to pay a service fee every time.\n\nBy the end of our 2-year contract I was totally done with these people, but unfortunately, renting prices had gone WAY up, and nothing else close by was in our budget range. We asked a few months before our lease was up if they would be willing to renew the lease with us (considering we felt like they hated us, and we totally hated them), and they told us they would let us know before 60 days of the end of the lease. At 11:30pm on the last day they could still legally inform us, they sent us the lease renewal agreement, which included a 25% rent increase, and new clause stating that all damages the landlord deemed to be the tenants fault were to be solely covered by the tenant. Oh hell no! They already acted like everything was our fault, there was no way I was going to give them legal permission to make me pay for everything! Plus, they wanted to charge me 25% more to stay in the same broken-down house? Screw that, we were moving. At first my husband tried to negotiate the price down, because he was shocked they would ask that much increase just to stay in the house. They countered that if they were to turn around and rent it to someone new, that they would be able to charge 35% more, and that the 25% increase was really giving us a break considering the going rate. So we decided that since we were going to be paying more anyway, we might as well move to a nicer house with nicer landlords. All 3 of my kids were going to finally be in school full time, so I could pick up extra work to pay the difference. We found a place that was a little more expensive than the cost of staying in our old house, but with twice as much space and a really nice neighborhood. My kids could stay in the same school, so it wouldn’t be too much upheaval for our family. I waited until 11:30pm on the last day that I legally had to inform the landlords of our decision to renew, and I sent them an email stating that their house was really not a good fit for our family anymore, and that we would not be renewing our contract. This was 30 days before our lease ended.\n\nThey retaliated by sending us a list of all the repairs that we had to make sure were completed before we moved out, which included a lot of small things, but also big things like:\n\n·       Spackling all holes in the walls and repainting\n\n·       Removing any modifications we had made, such as shelving units, guard rails, and the partitioned office we set up in the unfinished basement, complete with lighting and flooring and walls.\n\n·       Replacing the bedroom door that one of our kids broke – which was not a standard size, and would need to cut and sanded to fit the doorway\n\n·       Leaving the yard in the exact condition we found it in\n\n·       Fix the flooring in the bathroom that had mold build up underneath it\n\nThis last one was particularly irritating, because they flooring by the tub had not been properly sealed, so ANY amount of water on the floor was going to run under the floor and cause mold. In fact, the base sealing that ran around the entire bathroom outline was about 3 inches short of the length in needed to be in order to run flush with boarder of the floor, and whoever installed it decided to leave that 3-inch gap at the middle of the tub rather than some place unnoticeable, like in the closet. The landlords insisted that the mold was our fault and that the unfinished seal had nothing to do with it. Then they got angry when I pulled up the flooring to determine the amount of mold damage, because it meant the floor needed to be completely replaced. They acted like if I had carefully pealed it back I could clean the mold and put the exact flooring back down. This wasn’t stick on squares, this was a roll of linoleum flooring that was over 15 years old and had been glued down with professional grade adhesive. Reusing the same flooring was NOT an option, as it was brittle and breaking apart. He was also mad that I mentioned to one of the professionals who came to give a quote that there had been mold involved at all (this was after I had removed the adhesive and mold), and said I was ruining their chances of getting a cheap quote.\n\nAfter 3 different quotes for the bathroom floor, they refused to approve anyone, because every quote included needing to test for asbestos, which the landlord wasn’t confident would end in his favor. So, I told him I would do the work myself (I’ve put in flooring several times before, and I worked construction with my dad growing up, so I know what I’m doing). At this point, we only had 2 weeks left before we needed to be out. In the midst of all of this, my husband’s uncle passed away in a very traumatic and shocking event, and he ended up flying across the country to attend the funeral and be with his family. This left me alone with 3 kids to do all the repairs and finish moving into the new house. And in the meantime the landlords also insisted on approving all the materials I purchased to make the repairs in the home.\n\nWhile all this is happening, our neighbors were pissed at the landlords for pushing us out. We had really good relationships with all of them. One neighbor was like a grandma to my kids and was always baking them goodies and inviting them over to play with their dogs. The neighbors across the street would always sit on the porch and chat with us on summer evenings. We brought cookies to everyone on our block during holidays and made it a point to get to know everyone’s names and know their families. It was a REALLY tight community. Even before the landlords/owners turned nasty though, everyone told us how terrible they were, because they had lived in the house themselves and the neighbors all knew them. Before our family moved in, they landlords would only rent to people from their home country, who usually didn’t speak English, and didn’t like to interact with anyone else in the neighborhood. On several occasions the landlord admitted to neighbors that he did not want to rent to anyone who wasn’t like “his people” because it just didn’t feel right.  We were the first family who had rented that house that felt like an addition to the community rather than someone hiding from the community. When our neighborhood found out they had bullied us into moving, they were very upset.\n\nDuring the last week (the same time that my husband was gone for the funeral), I realized that I was way in over my head, and wasn’t going to be able to finish all these repairs and cleaning by myself. We reached out to the landlord and let him know that it would take us a few days past our lease to finish up the repairs, but that we were willing to do the work. He lost his mind. He told us that if he didn’t get the house back in the exact same condition it was in by midnight on the last day of our lease, that he would charge us an extra month of rent plus sue for damages because it would be time lost that he couldn’t rent it out to someone else. We reiterated that my husband was at a funeral, and they had just barely approved the work on the repairs and materials a few days earlier. His response was to \"kindly follow the contract\" or he would take legal action.\n\nSo, our neighborhood and church congregation came together and spent those last few days working on the house so that everything was fixed and in accordance with what the landlord demanded. One person painted, another person finished the flooring in the bathroom, one family had their kids come over to pull weeds, another guy brought tools to cut and sand the door to fit properly. EVERYONE agreed that all the repairs were things the landlord should be handling and shouldn’t be our responsibility to personally repair or even coordinate the repairs for. These were things that should be covered in a deposit. The landlord acted like he had someone ready to move in the moment we were out and that he was going to lose that contract if the house wasn’t ready. Spoiler alert, he didn’t.\n\nEven after we turned the keys over, the landlord wanted to nitpick and make us come back to fix small things, which we flat out refused and told him he could take it out of our deposit. 30 days after we moved, we received a bill from the landlord. He nickeled and dimed us out of every last cent of our deposit, despite all the repairs and work the entire community had done. Stupid claims like $150 to replace a window screen that had a hole in it, when I know he either wasn’t going to fix it at all, or just buy a $2 repair kit from Walmart. $800 for water damage to a kitchen drawer because there was some bubbling on the bottom, something that I know he was just going to put an insert on to cover it. He even cited damages that had been there since before we moved in, and he had himself charged us a service fee to fix several times, but the issue remained because he never properly fixed ANYTHING. His bill was in excess of $500 of our actual deposit. Some of it was to cover utility fees that I had already directly paid to the city. I sent receipts of my payment for the utilities and told him I was not paying him anymore money. If he wanted to withhold my entire deposit, so be it, but he wasn’t getting another dime out us. If he wanted to sue, go for it. We never heard from them again, but I was still pissed. My neighbors were still pissed. And we all wanted revenge, even if it’s petty.\n\nBecause the new house we moved into was only about 5 minutes away, my kids still went to the same school – the one that is 500 feet from the old house. I drive past it EVERY day taking my kids to and from school. And we also still go over just to visit neighbors. Here is what I found out from chatting with them:\n\nEvery time the landlords would bring someone in to show the house, the next-door grandma would make sure she or her husband were doing yardwork. They would make sure to strike up a conversation with the prospective tenants, and always mention how the last family who lived there was so wonderful, and it was really awful that they only reason we had moved away was because of how the landlords treated us.\n\nSomeone (I still don’t know who) took to knocking on the doors and windows at all hours or the night, which sent alarm notifications to the landlords. They started to keep his personal car parked in the driveway of this unoccupied house to deter break-ins.\n\nMy neighbor who liked to sit on the porch and chat with us in the evenings decided that anytime the landlord was doing landscaping work was a time my neighbor wanted to be enjoying his peace and quiet. He yelled at the landlord for making too much noise so often, that the landlord ended up buying all new landscaping equipment that was electric and specifically intended to reduce noise.\n\nThe house sat empty for 6 months before they got new renters. I watched the price move up and down on Zillow every month. At first, they tried to rent it out at $800 more than what we had been paying. Then it steadily dropped each month until they were asking nearly what our original rent was. Eventually they rented it out, and it was much cheaper than we had tried to negotiate them down to, which gave me great satisfaction. I found a way to introduce myself to the new family within the first a couple of weeks that they lived there. It was easy to spot them during school drop off and pick up times since they walked their kids to school. “Oh, you just moved in? We used to live there! The neighbors are so nice. I hope you don’t have too much trouble with the landlords!”\n\nAfter a little over a year of the new family living there I noticed a moving truck. I had done the math and knew that they were still in the middle of their lease. I decided to be super petty. I knocked on the door and reintroduced myself, and verified that they were moving. Then I unloaded everything the landlords did to us during our move out process, and how they screwed us out of thousands of dollars, even after we did all the repairs. I gave them pictures of our move out process so that if they landlords tried to charge them with certain damages, they could prove that it existed before they moved in. I gave them contact information for everyone who worked on the house before we had moved out so that they could have a timeline of all the damages that I’m certain the landlord would try to pin on them. They verified that the landlords had been unbearable, and were the main reason they were moving out. And once again the landlords had sent a laundry list of repairs the family was required to fix before moving. After our conversation, the husband told me he was going to inform the landlord that he would only do the cleaning and repairs if they landlord returned their entire deposit up front, otherwise he wasn’t going to do anything beyond removing his possessions from the property.  I’m assuming he didn’t get his deposit back, because a few weeks after they moved, I saw the landlord and his wife in front of the house. They had hired someone (not a professional) to clean up the yard, and they had set up an umbrella and chairs to shade them while they micromanaged the work this poor laborer was doing in the hot sun.\n\nThe house has sat empty for over a year now. According to our old neighbors, who we are still good friends with, they have only shown the house a couple of times. It’s both for sale and rent, at much cheaper than going rate, but no one wants it. As I understand, the neighbors still do what they can to harass them. Someone went back to knocking on doors and windows to set off the alarms, because the landlord has his car parked there 24/7 again. One neighbor also reported him to the city for blowing his leaves across the street into the park rather than bagging them himself, and I hope he got a hefty fine and lots of backpain every time he had to rake and bag his own leaves. Now it’s covered in snow, and because the house is so close to a school, they have to come over and ensure the walkways are salted and shoveled. It sure is a lot of extra work for a house that is empty and not bringing in any income. Every time I drive past to drop my kids off at school, I see that for sale sign and get the sweet satisfaction that they aren’t making any money on that house, and that they aren’t terrorizing anyone else.  \n\nAnd in case anyone is interested, the new house we moved into has the most amazing owner/landlord. They have never harassed us, they’ve fixed anything that’s gone wrong with the house without any complaint, and the only time they charged us anything beyond the agreed rent was when a bracket on the garage door broke because my kids left something in the way, and they asked us to cover the cost of the new bracket, which was less than $50. We’ve lived here nearly 4 years now, and love it.",

    "text": "Refuse to let my dad go to his sister's wedding? I hope you like tough questions. Mods: politics mentioned but in a non specific or partisan way, I assume it is okay\n\nThis is a story from my dad during the era of mandatory service in the Belgian army. I apologize if I get any details wrong but this is 2nd hand and an older one by now. Game of telephone may apply.\n\nDuring his time in the army, my dad's sister got married. The army was required to allow soldiers to go on leave for these kinds of events (except I assume during emergencies). However, his commander apparently did not seem to care much for rules like that. During a military exercise, the commander expected my dad to be present and did not allow him to leave for his sister's wedding. My dad was pretty annoyed and so told my grandpa, who at the time was a politician. My grandpa was known to be a bit of a bulldog in politics in the way that he did not back down. The reason this fact is relevant is because of my grandpa's status as a politician he had contacts. Grandpa said he'd handle it.\n\nLong story short, the commander suddenly received a politely worded letter on his desk from the **Minister of Defense** asking for the reason for the refusal. According to my dad, the commander furiously called him into his office and stammered something along the lines of \"I will let you go to the wedding. I don't know how you pulled this off, but it will have consequences\". My dad played dumb for the rest of his time in the army. His commander never did punish him, nor did he bother him again. The commander never ended up knowing how that letter ended up on his desk.",

    "text": "Fun in the waterpark This happened last summer in an European city. Sorry for any mistakes, as English is not my natice language!\n\nOver here we have those big public outdoor pools. One weekend kind of a \"Pool Olympics\" were hosted in an outdoor pool. Basically it was all meant to be a fun family event: everybody could sign in with a team and then a couple of more or less funny games were played in the water. It was fun for the kids.\n\nOur team consisted of 5 persons: two 12-year-old girls, two 11-year-old boys and one mom. So they played, won a couple of preliminary games and then there comes the semi final: It was a race in the water, where one team member had to sit on a floating rubber flamingo and the other members pulled it across the pool and back. After a couple of races everybody noticed that one lane was sginificantly faster than the other. So did my kids.\n\nAs they were ready, they paced to the fast lane and reached it first. But, there comes Karen from the other team and pulls away the handle. The hosts, mainly students, did not notice anything. And for little kids it is hard to stand up for themselves against adults. So Karen and her family just occupied the flamingo. Karen was in a team with her husband and two boys of about 13-15 years. As strenght matters in this race, they probably would have won it anyway. But still...\n\nAfter the race my son was devastated and really, really mad and angry. Especially, because he and his friend reached the rubber flamingo first. I was not able to calm him down, as he is very competitive and cannot handle unjustice well. But wait, here comes the final...\n\nIn the grand final, the members of the two teams had to run across the pool, collect some things from the other side and run back outside of the water. A couple of times, until they collect everything. Funny thing is: the organizer handed out water guns to all the other participants. So as the finalists were running in and outside of the water, they were targeted by about 50 water guns!\n\nMy son did not want to participate. I told him, if I was you, I would go for Karen. He changed all of the sudden, had this look in his eyes and called up his friend. And yes, the race started and the two boys were only going for Karen! It was good to see their satisfaction. As Karen jogged back outside of the pool he hit her right in her head and laughed \"headshot\" to his friend. At the end, Karen was all exhausted.\n\nAnd yeah, it might be that I accidently stepped in Karen's way when she jogged back outside of the pool. And as she tried to avoid me, I did the same, but swerved to the wrong side. Then she changed sides and me too. And again. Oh, so unlucky. Oops, you lost a couple of seconds.\n\nOver motivated Karen did not win. Justice was served wet. And my son really enjoyed the final!",

    "text": "Dressed down so I stood up I worked in an office where they promoted a very new, unexperienced, unqualified, suckup from an entry level guy to a team lead. One of three under the manager. There were roughly 30 people on the team. HR rules stated that he wasn't allowed to apply due to having been at the company &lt; 1 year, had zero leadership experience, etc, etc. Grievances were filed with HR and dropped despite multiple, fully qualified individuals with spotless records being in the running. \n\nHe was known to be a suckup, and wasn't really liked prior to his promotion. After the promotion he was wildly hate.. Apart from a couple sycophants. Quite entertaining, in retrospect, how people will degrade themselves for the barest scraps of power... \n\nAnyways, middle management knew he was reviled and told him he had to find a way to get people to like him. His solution was \"not required but you should think of them as required\" happy hours every month. For the first one, most everyone felt like they had to go and started figuring out how to fit it into their schedule. Some of these people had an hour drive each way and were finding sitters for their kids. These people were terrified they would lose their jobs if they missed drinking a few beers with the boss. (I should note that he has roped in everyone under the manager, I'm not even technically under this guy)  \n  \nI knew my rights and declined the invite. He comes by my cube a few times and the day of to try to pressure me into being there. Dude, there is no way I'm spending my free time with work people. You can either keep me on the clock or you can't ask me to be there, I know my rights. (I liked my team members well enough, had been to parties at their houses, etc, but I'm not going out with the Team Lead under any circumstances) Team Lead did not like that, and walked away in a huff.\n\nNext day everyone comes in and everyone is pretending like they had fun when it's very clear they're just trying to get away from Team Lead's attempts at chumming with them. Around 10 we have a standup and he talks about how great it was to have everyone at the thing. Then he singles me out, talks about how anti-social I am, and how management notices when people aren't team players. Don't skip required events, etc.\n\nLOL, okay dude.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I email the entire team \"Hey all, &lt;team member&gt; asked me about required after work events that are unpaid so I figured i'd share with everyone. State statute &lt;blah&gt; says that for hourly employees like us that we can't be required to go to these sorts of things without being on the clock. So if you can't find a sitter and can't make it, you don't need to worry at all\"\n\nTotally friendly, totally non-confrontational. Totally effective. Team Lead sat by himself at the bar for the next two \"required but not required\" happy hours and had to find another way to force people to like him.",

I am sitting there talking with them when the phone rings. Mom's eyes roll. Dad gets up and answers the phone.  Next thing I see he has a piece of paper in front of him and is rattling off numbers - \"The 15B?  The 17A? Ok, 20 minutes\"\n\nHe sits down and goes back to the conversation where it was left off.  I'm like whoa, hold the phone (literally), \"What was that all about?\"\n\n\"New Chinese restaurant.\"  He hands me their menu, \"Really, really good too!\"\n\nMom chimes in, \"Right up the street. Walking distance.  They are the best!\"\n\nDad grumbles, \"Our number is 3391.  Their number is 3397. Fuckers who can't put on their glasses before dialing can go hungry.\"\n\nEdit:  I am sure the only reason mom let him do this - she probably tried to tell people they had the wrong number and they got shitty with her.",

    "text": "Revenge for a broken toilet For about 5 and a half years, I saw a psychiatrist, \"Dr. Hag,\" who ended up being worse than useless. I even needed further help elsewhere to deal with her psychological damage. It's complicated, but one thing was clear enough: She seemed fine in the beginning, but had somehow eventually become a horrible, judgmental person. It took me way too long to finally stop seeing her.\n\nFor a stretch of time, as things were gradually going down the tubes with Dr. Hag, the single-bathroom toilet in her office space was broken. She and her office-mates could use the bathroom in the lobby of the adjacent building, but patients were out of luck. So I guess that's why no one working there had bothered to call a plumber... yet. For some reason, I'd usually suddenly have to go – badly – during our session, and during the time the toilet was broken, I'd have to leave early to use a Starbucks bathroom two or so blocks away. It's an absolute miracle that there wasn't an evil bathroom code lock on that door. I tried to change my appointment time to avoid this, but Dr. Hag refused to reschedule me. This went on for over a month, maybe close to two months.\n\nOne day, I had had enough. Dr. Hag's office toilet was still broken. This time, since the urge didn't strike until later in session, I managed to hold it in through the end. I left her office, sat down in the waiting room, waited for Dr. Hag's next client/victim to enter her office, waited another 10-15 seconds, and then went and took a monster shit in the broken toilet. I don't think I would have made it to the Starbucks bathroom anyway. There was water in the toilet, so it looked normal, but it wouldn't flush, so someone could have easily not known it was broken.\n\nI guess this led someone to finally call a damned plumber, because when I went back the following week, the toilet was fixed. She never asked if it was me; maybe because I made it look like another client could have done it. I hope my petty revenge stunk up the waiting room.",

    "text": "How about you don't try to ruin someone's day? I don't know if this is the right subreddit because I was not the giver of the revenge, it was a deity looking over me, but I reaped all the glory. I saw a car down the street that reminded me of this story.\n\nIt happened around 12 years ago. I (29M, then 16) was going home in the rain with my friends from school. As you know, teenagers are a bunch of chaotic gremlins that cause mayhem when in groups. They walk in the rain, sing loud when having fun, climb trees, etc.\n\nThis particular afternoon wasn't raining hard, it was falling droplets, so we didn't require an umbrella. The curbs, however, were drowning with the amount of water running down those street drains.\n\nThen it comes a car. The streets were large enough to fill with two cars side by side, and even a third, so this car didn't need to even touch the curb water, but this dude swerved out of his way to drench us. And I mean it, he wanted us to evolve back into fish with the speed he picked up. As soon as we saw the dude accelerating, we grabbed whoever was not paying attention and pushed near the wall, because we thought he was gonna hit us, not splashing some dirty water.\n\nMy particular group of friends always kept to ourselves and made fun of each other, not outsiders. I think this is what God or another higher being used to apply judgement in that situation. I remember thinking about my dog waiting for me at home while I held one of my friends in front of me with my back turned to the car. Suddenly, a really loud 'clunk' noise and a little water splashed my butt (either that of I shat myself, hard to remember). We looked back, and the car was standing next to us, smoke coming from the tires (I think? Either there or somewhere else) and the lower front of the fender caved in.\n\nWe were saved from this particular tsunami thanks to our city inferior infrastructure. Water drainage was a problem in some places, so people used to put stuff in drains to prevent leaves and things from blocking the water. This time was a metal rod sticking out of the drain. The impact caused the rod to break in half, not before reshaping dude's fender and cracking the pavement.\n\nWhen we saw that, my friends made sure to try and humiliate the man by [pointing and laughing](https://giphy.com/gifs/simpsons-nelson-the-UU1bHu6QWyFxZM63Jh) so theatrically loud that we almost forgot the fear we felt. Dude was pissed, but what was he gonna do? Beat a buncha kids? The impact site was fixed not too long ago, but the lesson we all got was: Don't be an asshole in the rain, and don't try to screw a bunch of teens minding their business.",

    "text": "I faked a haunting when i was 12 To preface, i’m the youngest of 3, at the time i was f12, and the oldest child was f15. She was going through a phase of teen angst and was really a terror to be around, so i retaliated whenever i could in secret, even going as far as gluing all her items down to her dresser with super glue after she was mean to me (i don’t remember exactly what happened unfortunately) but For example, she had candles, glued down and glued shut, perfumes glued down and glued shut, even her deodorant was glued down to the dresser and glued shut. Funniest thing is, my parents were also getting aggravated with her so they didn’t even ground me for it, but they did ground me for lying about it when i was confronted by them. \n\nNow to get to the story, we had a family friend pass away abruptly and prior she had been staying with us. She didn’t get along the best with my sister as she was again rude to her but sister was still upset after she passed. We’ll call the family member Mary for easier context. Mary was in her last trimester of pregnancy the first few months she was with us, and ended up having her baby and staying with us a bit after until some things happened and she moved out. She was notorious for drinking diet coke, and LOVEDDD lemon pepper seasonings. She put it on everything while pregnant and drank around a 2liter of diet coke daily. this will give context later.\n\nFast forward a few months after she passed away and My sister had been giving me crap about something, again i can’t remember what it was but i was pissed. She had stashed some chips in her room so i took them when she wasn’t home and coated them in Cayenne pepper. Around a week later she asked me if the chips smelled like lemon pepper seasoning to her and that’s when i got the idea. i agreed and said they definitely had been coated in lemon pepper and that’s odd, and made a joke that Mary was getting revenge for all the times sister was rude to her. \n\nafter a few days sister was again being a terror and stormed out of the house. i got another idea. Mary’s room hadn’t been fully cleaned out yet so i found some half drank diet coke 2 liters and shoved them under her bed, one in her closet, and one in her dresser to really seal the deal. \n\nThe next day she found the one in her dresser and FREAKED out, thinking Mary was haunting her. a few days passed and she found the one in her closet and again freaked out about it. Finally after a month or two when things calmed down, she cleaned her room and Behold: the diet coke stash under her bed. At this point she was petrified that Mary was coming back to haunt her because of how she treated her, even tried to convince my mom we needed to hire a priest. After that i figured i’d relax with the Mary pranks because i was starting to feel bad about it. \n\nTo this day i don’t think i’ve ever actually told her the truth behind it but she also could’ve forgotten it even happened by now. My mom was eventually told by me what happened and she was mad at me at first but came around and laughed it off sooner or later. I don’t think my sister uses this reddit forum but incase she does, I’m sorry and so is Mary.",

    "text": "Hope you like stickers. My first car was a Chevy Aveo, a little putt-putt car that I could fill up for maybe $20, and I beat that car into the ground because I bought it brand new and fully paid it off. At the end of its life, it was missing door handles, the gas door cover, you name it. \n\nA few days before I was gonna sell it to one of those Cash4Cars dealers, I happened to get in a little scuttle with a woman in a parking lot, because she parked SO close to my passenger side door that she dented it when she got out and got her red paint on the side mirror she also cracked. She was very heavy set, so I know she was leaning into her door when she got out, hence the damage. \n\nI was literally sitting in the car as she did it. At first I was polite and said something like \"maam, you just dented my car with your door, we should exchange insurance please.\" \n\nAnd she just kept walking away, like she did nothing, kept ignoring me calling her out as she waddled away, and I know she was ignoring me, because she kept looking back at me and waving me off.  \n\nWell that didnt fly with me, so I followed her in the store ready for a showdown, but instead I found one of those sticker machines for like $0.50 with the ugliest stickers you can imagine. I bought a bunch and just went to town sticking them all over her car, the windshield, and especially her driver side door. \n\nMoved my car over about three rows and parked between some other cars, because I wanted to see her face when she saw the stickers. I was probably waiting like half an hour, but it was worth it. She was cussing and throwing the biggest hissy fit of her life as she walked around her car finding sticker after sticker.\n\nIdc if my car looked beat up, its not an invitation to damage it further and not take accountability for it.",

    "text": "I'm smarter than you Ricky Back in school there was this one kid in my class who always had to be the center of attention, his name was Ricky. (There's always a Ricky.)\n\nOne afternoon in English class Ricky was sat behind me. Ricky wasn't exactly... academically inclined, and so on this afternoon Ricky had decided that his entertainment was going to consist of him kicking the back of my chair at random intervals. I just ignored it for a while but near the end of the lesson my patience finally snapped and I turned around and gave Ricky the middle finger. Immediately, Ricky started pointing at me and yelling at our teacher, \"Sir, sir he swore at me, he swore at me.\"\n\nNow, there's two things you need to know: Firstly this was a Christian school in the mid 1990s, swearing was a big deal. Secondly, in the UK there used to be two different ways of \"giving the finger\". One was the middle finger and the other was raising the index finger as well in a V shape.\n\nAnyway, the teacher comes over to investigate Ricky's yelling, he looks over at me and I immediately deny everything. The teacher sighs and asks me to follow him out of the room. Once in the hallway he turns to me and asks again if I swore at Ricky, I continue my denials. Then he says, \"Okay, but if you were going to give somebody the finger, how would you do it?\"\n\n\"Well sir, I don't really know.\" I reply (please note at this point that butter wouldn't melt in my lying mouth), \"But if I was forced to, I guess...\" at this point I \"reluctantly\" perform the 2 fingered version for my teacher, (please note, this is not the 1 fingered version I'd actually used).\n\nThe teacher nods and sends me back into the classroom before calling Ricky out instead. I didn't get to hear that conversation but I can only assume that Ricky was asked to describe how I gave him the middle finger and that his answer was inconsistent with my own. After a couple of minutes, an extremely unhappy Ricky was forced to come back into the class and apologise to both myself and the whole class for causing disruption. How I managed to keep the smirk of my face, I'll never know.",

    "text": "Gave my friend's boyfriend HER phone # when he hit on me at a club Years before everyone had a cell phone, I was at a club. I noticed my friend's boyfriend from numerous photos. I knew he cheated on her. She caught him once and she forgave him. I can't stand this guy, even though I had never met him in person -until now.  So, he notices me and starts flirting with me. I gave him a fake name and pretended to flirt back a little bit.  He ultimately asked me for my phone number. I took a napkin (that's how we did it in the old days) and wrote my fake name and his real girlfriends phone number on a napkin.\n\nI guess he was tipsy because he didn't recognize the phone number. Later that night, he called and asked for \"Jill\" not my friend's name. She shared the story with me and I didn't fess up in the moment. She broke up with him soon after that.  A few months later, she met the most amazing man, who she ended up marrying. I broke the news to her then. She was grateful and actually thought it was hilarious.\n\n  \nEdit: To those doubting we did not have cell phones then. A few select people did, they were bigger than showboxes and I don't think they stored phone numbers. We also did have photographs.  \n\nHe was extremely handsome and tall. Thinking back, I was 90% sure it was him when I spotted him. When he introduced himself and the name matched, then I was certain it was him.\n\nNever did I imagine him calling. I thought he would recognize the number and know he had been caught.  He was a womanizer and drunk, or at least tipsy, hence not recognizing the number. Thank goodness he called. otherwise he might have been on good behavior for a couple of months and she might have missed out on the love of her life.",

    "text": "I'll help you advance your career as much as I can! I live and work in the UK for 10 years now. I'm from - let's say - country A. Used to work with a bloke from country B.  \nHe wasn't necessarily a bad guy, but he had a very weird *sense of humor.* Our countries aren't really friendly to each other and while I couldn't care less, he definitely brought that here with him. I was constantly a target of his jokes about why my country sucks (it does, but not for the reasons he thinks...) and the only nice thing about us are the girls he loves to... you know... because that's what his country would do to mine too.  \nAnd of course, he has nothing against me, he likes me, it's just that my nationality is what it is.\n\nWhen I left that workplace because I moved away, I was happy I'll never see him again. New town, new job, happy days, right?  \nRight...\n\nI was working at my new place for 4 months when I've got promoted to my current position, but that also involved moving to a different unit, where I - you guessed it - ran into this guy again. I was friendly towards him (I don't really hold grudges), especially since I just became his assistant team leader, and I didn't want to start my new role by having one against someone in my team.  \nHe wasn't happy. He wanted this job and he felt that I stole it from him, even though I was promoted out of blue; I never applied for the position, I didn't even know it exists, I was told on a Thurusday that \"That's what you gonna do from next Monday.\".\n\nAs the weeks went by and I learnt more and more about the work the unit does, I started to notice small mistakes in people's job, including his. I looked at it as an opportunity to learn how to lead and my boss was over the moon that I want to handle these small things on my own (that's why they promoted me though...), so I went around, talked to people, showed them the stuff I've seen, asked them if there's any way to avoid these mistakes or it's something to do with the material/machines/etc (they've had years of experience, I was there for a few weeks...), I tried not to blame anyone unless it was obviously a human error. I wanted to learn, not to criticize.  \nWhen I approaced him the first time, before I even had a chance to explain what's wrong with the stuff he's done, he tried to start an argument about why it isn't his fault (didn't say it was...) and how it's the company's fault if they promote people without having any experience on the job whatsoever. I couldn't fault him there, I didn't have much experience, but I wasn't promoted because I'm good on the shop floor, I was promoted because I think ahead and solve issues before they become problems, and that's an invaluable skill in the unit they sent me to.\n\nAnyway, the first few weeks trying to work with him was, let's just say, difficult.  \nUntil my old unit started to lag behind and they asked my boss for a few people to help them out. My boss thought it's another great opportunity to learn to lead, and he let me choose the people we send over. Now I knew that the job in my old unit sucks. It's hard work, it's noisy, it's hot, it just sucks, but it has one great benefit; it's full of team leaders and managers, and if you want to get a permanent contract, it's the best place to get it. I've got mine there. My *old friend* however*,* was still with the agency. Now how am I to take this great opportunity, to let him shine, away from him?  \nSo it took me less than a minute to make up the list. He was on the top of it.  \nHe was fucking furious. He knew that job sucks too, but I told him it'll definitely help him advance his career. He can show the gaffers how incredibly great he is at his job, and can secure a contract just as quickly as I did. Don't let it slip away, he can only win!\n\nHis life was hell for the next few weeks, and every single day I went over to my old unit (that's where the head office was, I had to turn in paperwork every morning) he looked at me like I killed his cat or something. I always smiled and waved at him, because - again - I don't hold grudges, right?  \nAnd then, a few weeks later, they offered me another position, which while sounded good on paper, was an absolutely horrible job in practice. I respectfully declined, but recommended him, because - again - who am I to stop someone to advance their career?  \nThey told me there's no chance that guy will ever even get a contract with the company, let alone getting any position whatsoever; he makes way too many mistakes, he's lazy, he's annoying, he's inappropriate towards other people, he can't work with anyone, and they're happy we sent him down there because they wouldn't want to pay *someone like him* any longer than necessary, but if he'd stay with us they'd never knew.\n\nBut hey, I tried to help. Really, really tried.",

    "text": "Hiroshima Museum I was in the Hiroshima A-bomb museum today.\n\nThe main museum experience is a walk down a few rooms where you see images of the victims, records, clothing etc. saved from the Hiroshima bombing. It's a very sad and cathartic experience imo. There's this story of a child that survived the bombing but still died of cancer as a 12 year old girl. The museum doesn't point fingers at any nation or people, it just shows the horrors of war that the civilian population experiences and urges peace and negotiation instead of violence.\n\nAt the end of the walk there is a \"journal\" where visitors are welcome to write down their thoughts, right after what they had just witnessed.  I was flipping through the pages -- everyone talks about peace, prayers, no war. And as I'm looking through the pages, a tourist stops by and asks \"hey are you gonna write something? You mind if I go first real fast?\" I actually did intend to take more time to think so why not. They started writing something down, took like 5 minutes...they appeared to be a short, Pilipino  guy, approximately in their 20s. He suddenly asked me where I'm from and I said \"California\", he responded \"Me too! I am from LA, but my family is Pilipino\". Ok well that's cool - I said. He then proceeded to ask me where I am \"really\" from since I have a slight accent. I said \"Oh yeah my fam is from X but I don't really speak their language\", the guy made a some smirky remark, something about \"well you're Americanized, I speak the language of my parents\". Ok now I felt bad letting them cut in front of me but whatever, they finished writing.\n\nAs they finished writing and left, I came to the journals and looked at what he had written. I was shocked. Mind you ALL the thoughts are about peace, how sad the coming is, how Hiroshima must never repeat itself. Which makes sense after what you see in the museum.\n\nThey had written \"You had it coming, WE won and you lost! Suck it. - Signed USA AF Pilot\".\n\nFirst of all  - ain't no way in hell that shawty is eligible to serve in the armed forces. Second - who \"we\"? The guy said he's Pilipino living in LA.\n\nThird - what the fuck?!\n\nWell I am not letting this bitch tarnish such a beautiful museum! I scribbled over their hateful words 3 times to make sure no one in that museum -- looking at the journals right after seeing the horrific images of dead children -- had to see such insults.\n\nPeople like this guy make me sick.\n\nIt happened today.",

To say that she drove me absolutely insane was an understatement. \n\nOne day I overheard her on the phone with her mother, absolutely losing it because her vag was super itchy, asking for advice for relief and whether or not she needed to go see her doctor. As luck would have it I was getting ready to go grocery shopping when I overheard all this and decided to pick her up some Vagisil. Left a note that says “hope this helps! Also, you may want to stop taking all your calls on speakerphone.” \n\nApparently that was all it took for her to find her indoor voice. I never heard another word out of her! Alexandria, if you’re reading this I hope it was nothing serious.",

The family who owned were kind, and not rolling in the dough. Definitely a community, quality before profits kind of place. The store had been around for generations/ long before the lofts were built on the street behind us.The recieving dock was on this street, so we got early morning deliveries. Despite it being a bit noisy , we always tried to keep the volume down and we never got complaints until this one entitled NIMBY loft dweller. He would come over to the bakery trucks and yell at them for  their \"loud clanking of bread carts!\" Later I found out he was blackmailing them / threatening to call in a noise complaint unless he got fresh bread/ or a treat.\nOne day I noticed him get out of his car ,a Volkswagon Jetta, to complain. He had a for sale sticker with his phone number, which I took down. I flyered the neighborhood with his at least 10,000 car for sale for 100 dollars ( looking for a quick sale! call me anytime!). I also was one of the many people who would call him/ then argue and complain about not being able to buy it for 100 bucks. He screamed, I am so sick of getting these calls!! Of course I gave his number to the bakery trucks. Eventually the guy dissappeared/ but I still called about the car every once in awhile years later.",

When Greg came back I sprayed him with the gun and he started yelling at me at the top of his lungs calling me a piece of shit and how he pushed me as a \"joke\" and that I ruined his clothes (even though he started it and I barely know him.) He proceeded to complain to my mother and aunt about what happened and everyone started laughing at him for being stupid.

Woman around my age who had just moved back to the city from the West Coast met with me about an empty room in my place. She said she wanted to try a \"new neighborhood\" (Park Slope for anyone familiar) and she thought my place was cute, etc. Great. Tedious roommate interview process over. Or so I thought. \n\nMaybe a week and a half later, I get a text from her saying that she \"just misses \\[her old neighborhood\\] Williamsburg too much\"; that she'll be moving out at the end of the week and since she was only there for half a month, she would be \"prorating the rent.\" She also wound up bailing on utilities as well. \n\nA couple of months later, she butt dials me. This was the era where most phone plans didn't have unlimited minutes. Now her minutes were going to get really limited. I left my phone in my room and proceeded to go do errands for a couple of hours. I come back and the phone call is still on. I go and take a bath, complete with drinking tea, listening to soft music and fizzy spa salts. Phone call still on an hour later. I go and read on my bed and either she hung up or the call dropped maybe 45 minutes later. The 225 minutes of talk time was probably worth a whole lot less than half a month's rent but at least it was likely a pain in the ass to deal with AT&amp;T or Verizon or whatever during that next billing cycle. \n\nThe chick who wound up taking her space lowered the roommate bar even more, after which I wound up getting my own place.",

He hits the cart my grandmother is holding, jostling her slightly.

We try to brush it off and continue shopping.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later I see him again, walking toward the bathroom. I immediately have a brilliant idea. I tell my grandma I'm going to go back to the produce section and hurry off. I find his cart quickly because he had a lot of water stacked in it. I wheel the cart off in the opposite direction and take it to the other side of the store and wedge it in a corner out of everyone's way near the employee entrance.

I used to have this neighbor who treated my tool collection like his personal rental service; except the part where you actually return the stuff. Most of the time I didn’t care, because I didn’t use the tools often, but I always ended up having to wander over days later to reclaim my own belongings. \n\nOne time I actually needed a tool back… only to find out he had “borrowed” it and then loaned it to one of his buddies. That tool vanished into the void forever.\n\nGranted I should have handled this better, but a few days later, to make this end, I asked to borrow his lawn mower. I made the excuse I always let you borrow my tools. I used it and put it back exactly where it belonged. I just “forgot” to return the keys. \nWhen he came over the next day demanding them back ( granted I was always friendly when asking for my stuff back ) “Oh! I remembered last night. I left them with Jimmy. He said he’d mail them back to you.” After the neighbor left, I actually went and put the keys in the mail. \n\nWeirdly enough (and at this point thankfully), he never asked to borrow anything from me again. \n\nEdit:\nCorrected grammar to appease the grammar police.",

I asked if I could bring a friend, older man in his 70's with no family and she said, \"no, let's just keep it family.\" \n\nThis really upset me for some reason - I think because I believe Thanksgiving should be about kindness and inclusion. My immediate thought was to respond, \"ok, if it's just family I'll stay home.\" But I didn't want to be that petty and dramatic and I squashed this impulse.\n\nI mulled this over all week and Wednesday it finally occurred to me how to get my revenge...I ordered a bakery cake to bring to dinner. \n\n1) it's cake, not pie. Pie is her thing and she always makes 5-7 different flavors and a cake will mess up the aesthetic. 2) this is the best cake in town and I figured some people (at least me) would only eat the cake and snub her pies. \n\nWhen I walked in, everyone asked what I brought and were excited about the cake. Grandma was speechless and just looked at it for 30 seconds, which was all I needed to feel good about her exclusivity. \n\nPlot twist: she asked to keep the last slice when I was packing up. I guess she heard people talking about how good it was and wanted to try it. So I guess it worked out for everyone!",

Small place, usually has a line of 5-6 people. There's this one guy who would show up, see the line, and then pretend to \"just remember\" he needed to ask the barista a question. He'd walk up to the counter, ask something stupid like what size the medium is, and then conveniently just order while he was already up there.\n\nHe did this at least four times that I witnessed. Nobody ever called him out because, you know, confrontation before coffee isn't worth it.\n\nSo I started playing the same game. Whenever I'd see him walk in and start heading toward the counter with his \"I have a question\" routine, I'd quickly step out of line and beat him to it. Then I'd ask the most annoying, time-consuming questions possible.\n\n\"What's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino again?\"\n\n\"Do you have oat milk? What about almond? Soy? Which one froths better?\"\n\n\"Can you explain your whole pastry selection?\"\n\nAnd then I'd say \"Oh actually, let me get back in line and think about it\" and go back to my spot. He'd be stuck standing there looking like an idiot.\n\nAfter about a week of this, he started just waiting in line like a normal person. Problem solved. Haven't seen him try to cut since.",

Mail from his bank, government agencies, and half a dozen other companies was all getting delivered to us.\n\nThe first few of his letters we received, I did the responsible thing, wrote \"return to sender, recipient moved\" on the envelopes and put them back in the mail. After a month of continuing to receive his mail, I just started tossing them directly in the trash. I figured if he can't be bothered to update his address, I shouldn't be bothered to send it back. And so was the status quo for the next 3 years.\n\nThe frequency of the misdirected mail slowly decreased as time went on, but every month or two we would get something with his name on it and directly into the trash it would go. That all changed when one very peculiar letter landed in our mailbox, a birthday card.  Up until now, I had refrained from opening any of this guys mail, but curiosity got the better of me and I opened the birthday card.\n\nInside the card was a lovely note from this guys parents, and a cheque. In my part of the world personal cheques have the contact information of the account holder on them, so I called his mom. I was polite, and let them know that their son had moved out nearly nearly 4 years ago, and that i was tossing the card &amp; cheque in the trash.\n\nI like to imagine that the guy got chewed out by his parents for not giving them an updated mailing address, because we haven't received any more of his mail since then.",

She’s on marriage 4 with all marriages ending in her infidelity. She won’t take no for an answer and believes that it is easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission. She complains she’s unhappy with husband #4 but can’t leave due to finances. However, she only works 15 hours a week and her side gigs don’t bring in too much money. She mocks people when they offer to help her find more hours or help with her resume.\n\nI heard and witnessed a few odd stories about her. My friends had stories of places she’d show up uninvited in an effort to be alone with their partners. Then she turned her sights on my boyfriend. They are crazy about the same band and they both wanted to go see them. I had plans for the evening so I told them to go together. They had fun and she couldn’t stop going on and on how wonderful it was going out with my bf. I figured either she doesn’t care if she appears to be looking or doesn’t care how her husband might feel.  My bf liked the band but said very little about her. \n\nShe figures that my bf is her concert date now and comes up with a few concerts she’d like to go to. BF lets her know he’d like to bring me. Every time he does that she backs out the plans to the extent we begin to think she doesn’t want me there. Curious about this I decide to do a test.\n\nThere’s a cover band that came to town that she and my bf love. Again she brings up going with him. He tells her that I’ll be out of town, but he plans on going. They decide to go together and she even offered to cook dinner for him prior to the concert. About a week before she’s non stop texting him about the show. The day of show comes up and they confirm plans in the morning. Around 16:00 I send a group text to her and bf that I can make it to the show after all. She doesn’t respond.\n\nWe go to the show and a guy is sitting in her seat. Apparently he got the ticket very last minute from someone selling it. My bf has never heard from Savannah again about concerts again. She avoids us at parties as she does with most of the women in our group. Word to the wise avoid your buddy if they act like a pick me. Even if you don’t have a partner, they make horrible friends. \n\ntl;dr former friend has a wandering eye and is a pick me girl. She wanted my bf to herself for a concert until I let her know I’ll be joining them. She bailed on the concert.",

    "text": "She didn’t like it when accountability came calling for her! This is an attempt at a repost as I think I made a mistake in the original post about what was said.\n\nSo for a bit of background I (40m) work in a smallish office. Maybe 10 people and with varying WFH days there might actually only be 2 or 3 in the office. I’m quite new to the office too just a few months. \n\nA discussion was happening and an awful comment was made and I was disgusted. (I won’t say cause I think it’s why the last one was deleted)\n\nI haven’t felt rage like it in a long assed time, I don’t know how I didn’t start a scene and start screaming in the office. I was vibrating with anger! So I asked my manager who’s in another office and she said speak to HR and so I did and told them. The person who said it and the two that were there agreeing got pulled into a meeting. I got spoken to afterwards and I was told they have been spoken too and the manager apologised to me sincerely for what I had to experience and assured me it’s not something he’ll accept etc. all fine!\n\nYesterday no one spoke to me, I said hello when I came in and got no reply from 2 people that weren’t even there at the time. The three that got spoken to have been working from home since. When the guy opposite me was leaving yesterday I said nice and loud and clear “bye see you” absolutely nothing from him and he’d always say it before.\n\nToday we had a department wide meeting to discuss quality control and how much it costs the industry as a whole and how we can do better within our business. Well The Bitch pipes up with “It’s all about accountability and holding those to account for their errors”\n\nARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?\n\nI laughed but said nothing then the meeting moved on and the topic started about discussing how not reporting issues can factor into things and a bunch of “thoughts” from people about why they don’t report problems and it was something like “fear of nothing being done”\n\n“Scared of speaking up against something or someone” \n\nThe speaker asked “does this resonate with anyone?”\n\nI mean it was perfect! 🤩 \n\nI said \n\n“Yes absolutely 100%, I’ve definitely felt that but I think The Bitch made the perfect point and it comes down to the importance of holding people to account and not being afraid and stepping up and doing the right thing in the face of seeing something wrong. It’s really important that we continue to do that but it’s really hard to do because it’s really uncomfortable to have to do, no one wants to be that person.”\n\nWell it didn’t take long for her camera to be switched off, looked like she was about to burst into tears after she made a comment about “people need to understand that people all have their own stuff going on” and also a comment about “the teams needs to stick together cause that’s what teamwork is”\n\n\\#NotSorry\n\nI don’t care what is going on in your life nothing warrants the comment that she came out with that day, it was the single handed worst thing I’ve heard in 20year career to come out of another humans mouth.",

    "text": "Gaslight me at my job? Ok well I won't always work here... Years ago I worked for a small nonprofit with a great mission. It helped a lot of people, but the office environment was toxic AF. I worked there for six months and was gaslit like crazy. There were lots of small petty day-to-day things, but the piece de resistance happened toward the end of my tenure: I made a mistake with something public-facing, which I fully owned up to and apologized profusely for. They could've (and probably should’ve) fired me with cause for this mistake, but... they didn't. I was told that everything was fine, nothing further needed to happen, and to please be conscientious moving forward. I won't lie, I was surprised, but these guys were so in my head at that point I had this idea I should stick it out and prove myself at this job, so I took them at their word.\nThe next day, suddenly my main responsibility was delegated to someone else. So, everything's not fine? \"Nope! What are you talking about? Everything's normal!\" \"Am I getting new responsibilities?\" \"No just stick with what you're doing!\" You mean, half of what I used to do? Ok.... \n\nThe following week a coworker asked if I was coming to the holiday party, I said no, I was contract-to-hire and had been told by my manager so sorry, the party was full-time/salaried only. Whatever. Two days later the CEO's assistant emailed saying \"we never got your RSVP to the holiday party!\" So…my manager lied? Hurtful and rage-inducing, but at that point I didn't want to go anyway, so I informed them I was not able to attend. Ok....\n\nThe office closed for the holidays, and immediately after the new year I went in as normal, and was almost immediately called into a meeting. You can guess where this was going: Apparently due to budgetary concerns my position had been eliminated and they had to lay me off. What else could I say but: Ok... I collected references from the not-crappy people, packed up my stuff, went home, and destroyed the company mug they gave me on my first day with a hammer for some catharsis. \n\nSix weeks later I checked the company website while compiling my work history, and shocker: they had a new employee with a suspiciously-similar-but-legally-distinct job title, and responsibilities that were identical to mine! By that point I was well and truly out of fucks to give about that place, and was knee-deep in funemployment, but I filed that tidbit away as a good reminder of how shitty that place was to me.\n\nFast-forward several years: I was well-established in a much better job at a very well-respected company full of excellent people! I liked the org so much I volunteered on an internal committee led by my friend Michael, and we would partner with local orgs and nonprofits to help with community improvement and advocacy. While discussing potential orgs to partner with at our annual meeting, Michael mentioned the name of my old nonprofit! He said that there had been some preliminary conversations with the org about potential opportunities, and that it seemed like a good fit! So…after the meeting I hung back and I asked Michael if we could talk for a few minutes.\n\nI laid out every bit of two-faced nonsense that had happened to me there, and since Michael and I were friends I did not spare any details. Michael also happened to be very high up in HR! He had a…shall we say unique perspective on just how shitty the nonprofit was to me? That, perhaps, it was an indication that they were probably doing things I didn’t know about that were even shittier?\n\nWelp, after our discussion, Michael reached out to the nonprofit and let them know we wouldn’t move forward with a partnership, then he put the nonprofit on our company’s blacklist. They don’t know I was involved, or that by not treating me better when I was an employee, they missed out on a HUGE opportunity. Last I heard, they’re in a near-constant state of circling the drain. Meanwhile I’m up for a promotion. Living well is definitely the best revenge.\n\nEDIT for clarification: Several people pointed out I was bad at my job and should've gotten fired. You're right, as I said I should have gotten fired. But that wasn't discussed, nor was an improvement plan. Instead, the nonprofit told me all was forgiven, no worries, just do better, and convinced me to stay at my job. Then they spent weeks messing with me and my responsibilities before \"letting me go\" at the start of a new fiscal year.",

    "text": "Harass me for tickets, I will sell them instead I bought tickets to a really desirable concert with my cousin for $200 each back in February.  I’ve been looking forward to this concert all year.  A couple weeks ago my cousin told me she couldn’t go anymore and I can keep her ticket and invite a friend.  Even though she paid $200 for her ticket already, she said she didn’t want her money back that any friend I invite can go for free.\n\nI invite a friend of mine to go with me and she says yes.  She’s excited she can go and is grateful she got the ticket for free.\n\nThe day of the concert is coming up in four days and she texts me to let me know it’s forecast to snow the day of the concert and it will be super cold and windy with wind chills down to zero.  I check weather apps and decide to listen to the local news forecast on tv.  It doesn’t look good.\n\nI tell my friend that I don’t drive in the snow and can’t really take the train because the outdoor temp will be so low and in my area I sometimes have to wait for the train outside for 20 minutes or so and don’t feel comfortable being exposed to the cold for that long.  I also can’t Uber to the stadium because roundtrip would be too expensive.  I tell her if the weather is bad that day, I will just transfer the tickets to her and she can go without me.\n\nShe starts pressuring me to let her know ahead of time so she is “not scrambling at the last minute.”  I told her that snow and weather predictions are pretty variable in our area and I can’t really decide until the day of when I get a feel for how much snow has fallen (it is supposed to fall overnight) and see the condition of the roads and how bad the wind and the wind chill is.\n\nShe lives very close to the venue so it will be easy for her to get there, even if the weather is bad.  She again says that the right thing to do is to let her know a couple days ahead of time so she can find someone else to go with.  It’s making me uncomfortable that she’s already planning to go with someone else before the snow even hits the ground.  She has a friend she usually goes to concerts with who also lives near her so I knew in her beady little brain that she is planning a concert outing with her other friend and just wants me to transfer the tickets now instead of waiting for the actual weather event.\n\nI think about it for a minute.  I tell her that I’ve decided ahead of time since the weather will be bad, to list my tickets for resale and try to get my money back since I can’t go.\n\nShe responds with, “Wow.”\n\nI replied:  “Oh did you just expect me to transfer $400 worth of tickets to you before the snow even hits the ground?  Or do you want to buy the tickets yourself?”\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\nEven if the tickets don’t sell, I’m not giving them to her anyway.\n\nUpdate:  my friend texted me this morning and offered $200 for both tickets since my cousin already said she could have the other one free.\n\nI responded: “Wow that’s so nice of you.  A real friend would invite me to stay over in case of bad weather so I wouldn’t miss this once in a lifetime concert experience.  That’s what my cousin would have done as she also lives nearby.”\n\nI told you guys she was already planning on taking someone else!!  Nope, nope, nope.\n\nUpdate #2:  if she is willing to fork over $200 then why not offer to pay for my Uber costs which would be $150 roundtrip or offer to pay for a hotel if she doesn’t want me in her house?  It’s all fishy to me anyway.\n\nUpdate #3:  my tickets sold for full price so now I have $400 and can give my cousin her money back!",

    "text": "Give me a slow laptop coz I am a consultant - expect slower throughput So this happened more than a decade ago when I worked as a consultant to a major pharma company. Now to be fair they were great people nice working culture etc very friendly relations between the pharma company devs and our devs. All great. Great WFH policy (in fact all us consultants worked remotely).\n\n\n\nEverything except ONE thing. We all had laptops (shipped to the consultants) with very heavy software running on it and it was both CPU and Memory intensive. Again totally fair. As developers our job was to run these to locally run the code and develop it, modify it etc. One \\*BIG\\* difference. The regular employees got really great fast high speed machines. As \"Consultants\" we got the lower end ones, despite all of us having to debug and update the same code!\n\n  \nWe brought this up to our team leads/managers/VP and to their higher-ups that \"hey our overall throughput would be significantly higher and your own cost would go down if our laptops could run these local servers faster\". The employee developers and teams leads also helped us make that same case.\n\n  \nAverage laptop cost is say $1500 for a high end (at the time). Average cost of the lower end one say $800. So a difference of $700 per consultant (times say 10 consultants) would have brought the total cost to say $7K. Total amount of extra HOURS we billed them due to this MUCH MUCH higher.\n\n  \nBut of course the bean counters at the parent company said, \"no way in hell are we giving the lowly consultants the best machines\". Add to that our main business point of contact was a real piece or work and pushed back \\*just as vehemently\\*. After lots of pleading arguing etc, we gave up. Now our strategy was simple. We'd simply get less work done in the day. To give everyone an idea of how this works. Each time you change a line of code and save. To recompile + restart the server locally it would easily take 10 mins on our consultant laptops (as opposed to just 3 mins on the employee laptops). We would deliberately make it compile multiple times. When the employee business team complained we'd screen-share and show them each time they complained, how long it took for even minor changes.\n\n  \nFunny thing was the consultants were all remote so we'd put the code to compile and go have coffee or do household chores lol. Their POS business contact tried to crack the whip on us, we said \"hey there really IS no way for us to go quicker without quicker laptops\". After 6 months of them falling behind on projects AND being over billed due to to more hours being spent, they FINALLY woke up from their slumber and upgraded our laptops to bring them in line with the employee ones!\n\n  \nOf course 2 months after we got better laptops I found a much better job and left. Still reminisce about those long coffee breaks though! ;-) Funniest part was when I called their helpdesk once. The agent quite literally admitted. \"You know I have worked here for 10 years now and I'll NEVER understand why the Directors and VPs need top of the line laptops when all they they run is word excel and powerpoint and meanwhile the ones actually doing the heavy computing get 5 year old laptops\". Amusing anecdote lol",

    "text": "Finally stood up for someone who needed it Back in high school, I had this friend who always got picked on. She was quiet and kept to herself, and for some reason that made her a magnet for this one girl who acted like the queen of the hallway. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just constant little digs that added up. The kind that made you feel bad even when nobody else noticed.\n\nI remember seeing it happen a lot and just feeling useless. I wanted to say something, but I didn’t know how to do it without making it worse for her. So I stayed quiet, which honestly still annoys me when I think about it.\n\nFast forward to now. My friend and I were having coffee the other day, just talking about work and life, when that same girl from high school walked in. She looked exactly the same attitude and all.\n\nShe spotted my friend right away and said, loud enough for people to turn their heads, “Wow, you still look the same. Always so....plain.” then she looked at her from head to toe.\n\nI swear, something in my eye twitched. I just looked at her and said, “Yeah, she looks the same. Stable job, good life, no issues. What’s your situation now? Still starting drama for fun?”\n\nThe whole place went quiet for a second. She did this awkward laugh, like she was trying to pretend it didn’t bother her.\n\nThen she goes, “You’re being sensitive.”\n\nI told her, “If you’re still picking on people as an adult, that’s not being confident. That’s just sad. Anyway, we’re trying to enjoy our coffee. You can go.”\n\nShe didn’t even try to fire back. She just walked out, and honestly it was the most satisfying exit I’ve ever seen.\n\nMy friend looked at me after a few seconds and said, very quietly, “Thank you. I wish someone said something back then.”\n\nAnd yeah… I wish I did too. But at least I finally did now.\n\nps: I haven't seen that bully since.

    "text": "Before I quit my job back in August, I forgot I did something petty and net nanny'd the workstations This just got brought up to me via text from one of my old coworkers and I had completely forgotten about it and thought I'd share it. For context, I live in the Midwest.\n\nI had a friend at my previous job, who worked in IT. He was head of Cybersecurity and licenses, while I was project manager for the site and ran the facilities. He and I had to work hand in hand frequently, as we had government contracts and had to log in visitors and get them vetted sometimes, for a key fob to enter the facility. I would collect vendor information and pass it onto him, while he ran things and got permissions. Sometimes, I was upgrading onsite systems or installing new equipment for monitoring things like the new solar panels and what not. \n\nThis required me to install new programs to not only my computer but specific workstations as well. Prior to this current job, I had worked for the government as a contractor and my top secret clearance was a good selling point for me with this company, as it meant the IT department could work with me on things and use my own contacts I'd also established. I was also the IT Manager and understood the lingo and nomenclature, so needless to say, my friend and I worked well with each other.\n\nUnlike any other IT department I'd worked with or companies I worked for, this job HATED I.T. and treated them like the red headed stepchild. IT hindered production and they hated all the rules and procedures that came from them. More like a burden, than preventive. The company gave them the lowest miniscule budget I'd ever seen and never took any of what they said seriously. They overworked them and made them come in on weekends or stay late, citing \"that's why they're salary.\" \n\nI sympathized with them and tried my best to help or do the work for them, to take things off their plate. New Access Point needed installed? No problem, I'll use the scissors lift to do it. Need the Ethernet cable ran 100 yards from the roof to the hub? Sure why not. The trust, my helping and knowledge lead to my friend giving me admin access, for me to install or debug programs for him while he was stuck in hours long training sessions or meetings. The company wisely had certain workstations committed to one computer and if that crashed or acted up, it shut down production or the line. It was just easier for me to enter in administrator credentials and reboot systems or troubleshoot, rather than wait for them to get done by IT.\n\nMy friend left for another job across the country and I honestly had forgotten that I had administrator credentials. I hadn't honestly needed them for a while and I was busy with other things. Because I was in charge of the facilities, I was generally the last one out every single day. The workers had a bad habit of leaving every light on and the owner of the company would get triggered by it. It was just easier for me to stay 20 mins after the end of my shift and close up shop, after the stragglers or people finishing jobs. My last day wasn't any different than normal but with one small difference... I heard voices this time while I was closing up.\n\nI followed the source and one of the workstations was left unlocked and blaring on his webpage, Fox News on one page and Newsmax on the other.  Employees had been warned about this tons and the person who's station I was at, was a shit person to me. An evil idea came over me and then I remembered that I had administrator credentials. I went to the web settings and started blocking those sites. Out of curiosity, I went to another workstation and found their browsing history was the same. So I proceeded to do the same thing. I continued to do this at every workstation throughout only one plant. Not only was it foolproof but the stations were unlocked by the username of the department it was at but also a blanket work password. \n\nThe administrator credentials were also a blanket username and password, not tied to anyone. Keycards were only logged in the system for INBOUND, not outbound. It wasn't unheard of for staff to still be there finishing things up, hence my staying late, so you couldn't pinpoint who dun it. The timestamp for admin access might give it away but there's no cameras on the facility, IT is generally one of the last ones out as well. They could check the logs all they wanted, it was a different team than when my friend was there and they didn't know I had admin access, hell even I forgot I did too. Plus I was quitting. Good luck proving it wasn't one of you OR admitting there was a breach in security.\n\nI honestly forgot about it until one of my the plant managers messaged me out of the blue today. We had a snow storm last night and the solar panels were acting up and they needed to know how to reboot them. I told him how cuz I was helping HIM, not the company. So we started catching up and I asked how the skeleton shift was working for them. He said fine but they'd been trying to fight a \"glitch in the Matrix\" for a few months now. The weekend crew was hit with layoffs cuz of the winter and these tariffs. They're running a crew of 3 on the weekends and they've been doing ok but their chief complaint is they can't \"use certain websites\" for some reason. \n\nSince IT was overworked and it was just the weekend shift complaining, it was deemed a low priority but apparently it's starting to piss more and more people off and they're now unintentionally throwing themselves under the bus if they're complaining they can't watch Fox News(etc) on shift INSTEAD of working. Seems like a win win to me.\n\nTLDR:\nI had admin access and blocked all the right wing websites prior to quitting my job. Now if someone complains about it, they'll admit that they're not paying attention to their job and get in trouble.",

    "text": "You scratch my car I snitch you hitting people So my neighbors daughters keyed my car and has scratched the back of my vehicle several times over the last five months. With the winter weather and the lack of neighborly neighbors a lot of spots aren't shoveled and cars are getting stuck. I haven't seen one neighbor shovel or even the city pass by but I have a nest camera so..... it caught the daughter struggling to pull out for 5 minutes. I also recorded with my phone because my camera got accidentally disconnected and I knew she was going to end up hitting somebody. Well she did and the neighbor's daughter literally scratched up the back of the vehicle in front of her and hit the front of the front of the car when she skidded out the spot. Here's the bigger problem because she parked not just once but twice in the same spot where she got stuck again. She hit the same car two days in a row. I've been waiting for 3 days, but the owner hasn't checked on their car yet. I left a note with my number in case they wanted the video though. I'm still waiting because I want my petty revenge. I can't prove the damage on my car, but I can definitely prove the damage on the strangers car if they let me 😂😭.\n\nEven now 72 hours after the fact homie hasn't touched their car. I don't know who you are and I don't know where you live but I wish you'd read the note and text me so I can send you the proof. \n\nEdit the daughters is in her 40s 50s\nIve always wanted to used imgur https://imgur.com/a/oDBAcJ2\n\nFRI 7 am : He finally moved his car, its a man 😁 \nFRI 10 pm: sorry guys he didnt text my number so I guess he didnt care enough.\nMonday: he never sent a message so I guess dude doesn't care\nEdit:\nIt has now been a week since the incident and there's been zero communication so unfortunately I guess this is unfinished I will do my best to alert the authorities",

Every year, the students in the honors music classes put on a concert for teachers and parents. This is completely student led, so no teachers know what the songs are (we have a senior who’s basically in charge of everything, she was given permission to approve our songs and make sure it was nothing inappropriate so it could be a true surprise). My band teacher is problematic, to say the least. He has a short temper and I don’t think he really wanted to be a teacher if I’m being honest. He got mad at us in class one day and blew up at us, saying stuff like how we were hopeless and had no talent (not true, in case you were wondering). So we got plotting.\n\nMy friends L and N and I had the idea of rickrolling the audience, so we got composing. Basically we started off playing some traditional band piece, then the music stopped and the tenor sax played the intro to “Never Gonna Give You Up,” and it went from their. It. Was. Epic. The look on the band teacher’s face was PRICELESS. That was one concert for the history books.",

He must have saved over 100k on payroll in the 5 years I worked there doing this. Anyway, when I became a shift manager I made sure we took 2 hour lunch breaks, an hour break in the morning, and an hour break in the afternoon. and on slow days we would stand around do nothing for hours at a time. - all the while the job was being done, mind you.\n\nthe owner never found out as he never worked alongside of us. he would drop in on fridays to pay the bills, and occasionally call us to check in on things.\n\nIn the last year alone I would sit in the breakroom on my phone for hours at a time, only answering calls and talking to customers as they came in. I reckon in the last year 15/40 hours a week were spent doing absolutely nothing. Accumulatively I must have racked up close to 2000 hours doing absolutely nothing in a 4 year period. I always showed up on time, stayed late if needed, made sure the job was done correctly, and always treated the customers with respect.\n\nanyway, he promised me health insurance when I turned 26, but when it came time to do it he mysteriously couldn't afford it, so I left. \n\nthe next job I worked at, a hospital billing department, we had our work queue laid out on our screen every morning. I would shred through the queue in the morning, and sit on my ass the rest of the shift. I carry these lessons with me wherever I go :)",

    "text": "Our entire neighborhood got petty revenge against our terrible landlord TL:DR Our landlords bullied us into moving out, and then screwed us out of thousands of dollars. Now the entire neighborhood works to make sure they can't get new tenants and the house sits empty. So far they've lost out on nearly $50,000 of potential rent because of how long the unit has sat empty.  \n  \nIn 2020 my family moved to a new state for my husband’s job. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and renting costs were way down across the country, so we didn’t think twice when we found a cute little house that fit our needs and was well within our budget range. 2 houses down from the school my kids would be attending and across the street from a really nice park. The house had been empty for a while – we assumed due to the pandemic – and the landlord, who was also the owner, seemed eager to get it rented. We had a friend walk through the house for us on a video call before we signed the contract, and everything seemed like it would work out.\n\nAs soon as we moved in, things started falling apart. The blinds fell off the window the first time I tried to adjust them. The plumbing under 2 different sinks started leaking within the first week. The seal on one of the toilets broke during the first month. We called the landlord who came over and fixed everything on his own – but always asked that my husband help him (My hubby used to work construction, and the landlord wasn’t too great with home repairs). Then during the second month we lived there, the garbage disposal broke. When I informed the landlords, they responded saying that they could come fix it, but that they would need to charge me a $70 service fee for repairs “as per the contract” and then pointed out that they should have charged me a service fee for each separate repair they had already made, but they were trying to be nice since we just moved in. I was confused – In every place we have ever rented, basic home wear and tear was NOT the tenants responsibility. That’s the entire reason we rent! I read back over the contract and realized that the line including a service fee for repairs doesn’t specify for repairs due to misuse of tenant – just repairs in general. I argued with them that it was THEIR home and they were responsible for basic repairs, but they insisted that I “kindly follow the contract”. I got in touch with other landlords in the area and they all agreed that my landlords were correct. Because most of the developed housing in this area is between 50-100 years old, landlords know that basic wear and tear will cost them an arm and a leg every time something breaks, so they implement a fee to discourage tenants calling about every little thing that might break. But I wasn’t calling because a door came loose off the hinges or a drawer fell off the track, I’m calling because water is pouring from under the toilet or appliances have shorted out, none of which is my fault. Regardless, we were stuck paying a service fee every time the landlord had to come fix something, which ended up being at least twice a month throughout the entire duration or our 2-year lease. Every time I had to call about an issue, they found a way to make it sound like the problem occurred because of our misuse.\n\nBecause I had argued with them about the terms of the contract and insisted that these damages were NOT due to misuse, they decided we must be incompetent, and began micromanaging EVERYTHING. A few things they did:\n\n·       Came over to supervise my husband as he fertilized and mowed the lawn to make sure that he was doing it correctly.\n\n·       Drive by at least once a week to see that the grass was mowed, leaves were raked, snow shoveled, flower beds weeded, etc… and would message us if they felt we had neglected it even a little bit – we did NOT live in an HOA neighborhood. They always ended with their messages with “If it’s too much for you to handle, we can do it for you, but we would have to charge you a weekly fee”. Yeah right, over my dead body!\n\n·       Find “hazards” to nitpick every time they came into the house – the rug was a tripping hazard - you can’t put those boxes there, they block the walkway and it’s a hazard – you have to secure your trampoline to the ground because it might be a hazard – you have to take out the edging that you put around the flowerbed, someone might trip into it, and it’s a hazard. To say I hated these people is an understatement.\n\n·       Call us on holidays to harass us about menial issues, such as the last time we weeded the yard or fertilized. Then they insisted on receipts and proof, and implied that we were lying because they said the entire yard looked unsatisfactory. To be clear, my husband dedicated 4 hours every Saturday to the landscaping of this sucky 1/3 acre lot, and it was the nicest looking lawn and yard on the block\n\nWhenever we would call about repairs that we weren’t comfortable handling ourselves, they would give us instructions like we were children. They would tell us what repair tools to purchase and how to fix it, even if we weren't comfortable with it. They insisted we try to manage it first before they came and looked at it, even if it was an electrical issue or plumbing issue that would require us to make changes to the house (which was prohibited in our contract). At first, we played their game, but when the instructions they gave us didn’t work, they would always respond with “well you probably did it wrong, but I can come look at it for you. I’ll have to charge you a service fee though. Or you can just call a professional”. Another option they gave was that they could come observe us attempting to fix it, and give instructions as we go, but if they had to condescend to physically touch the issue or repairs at all, that they would have to charge us a service fee. I really hated these people.\n\nAfter arguing the first time this happened about how unfair it was to charge me a fee after I just spent a lot my own time and money attempting to fix it per their instructions without any success, I told them to forget it, I would just call a professional. They took offense to that, and told us that they had to approve any professional we called to fix the problem. If we wanted a pro to look at it, WE had to do the research and send the landlord a proposal about who to use, and they would make the final determination – and we would still pay a service fee because the repair had to be made regardless if a pro fixed it or if they fixed it themselves. On 3 different occasions we had a professional come out to give a quote – each time for a different issue. Every time, the professionals refused to even bother with a quote for the specific issue they were called on because it was always a smaller part of a larger problem that would require extensive remodeling and repairs to do it correctly and ensure the problem was fully resolved. These were for structural issues of the home, such as the foundation being poured incorrectly (which was very evident in the way the plumbing exited the basement) or the wiring being done wrong causing a fire hazard. Due to insurance issues, any professional would be unable to only address the immediate problem without making extensive repairs. EVERY TIME, the landlord would say he wanted a second opinion and then bring in a “handyman friend” who looked at it and said that they pro’s were trying to scam him, that it was an easy fix, and that they could MacGyver a solution without spending thousands of dollars. Each time their fix would only last a few months, and then the problem would occur again and they would come back and figure out another half-baked solution – for which we had to pay a service fee every time.\n\nBy the end of our 2-year contract I was totally done with these people, but unfortunately, renting prices had gone WAY up, and nothing else close by was in our budget range. We asked a few months before our lease was up if they would be willing to renew the lease with us (considering we felt like they hated us, and we totally hated them), and they told us they would let us know before 60 days of the end of the lease. At 11:30pm on the last day they could still legally inform us, they sent us the lease renewal agreement, which included a 25% rent increase, and new clause stating that all damages the landlord deemed to be the tenants fault were to be solely covered by the tenant. Oh hell no! They already acted like everything was our fault, there was no way I was going to give them legal permission to make me pay for everything! Plus, they wanted to charge me 25% more to stay in the same broken-down house? Screw that, we were moving. At first my husband tried to negotiate the price down, because he was shocked they would ask that much increase just to stay in the house. They countered that if they were to turn around and rent it to someone new, that they would be able to charge 35% more, and that the 25% increase was really giving us a break considering the going rate. So we decided that since we were going to be paying more anyway, we might as well move to a nicer house with nicer landlords. All 3 of my kids were going to finally be in school full time, so I could pick up extra work to pay the difference. We found a place that was a little more expensive than the cost of staying in our old house, but with twice as much space and a really nice neighborhood. My kids could stay in the same school, so it wouldn’t be too much upheaval for our family. I waited until 11:30pm on the last day that I legally had to inform the landlords of our decision to renew, and I sent them an email stating that their house was really not a good fit for our family anymore, and that we would not be renewing our contract. This was 30 days before our lease ended.\n\nThey retaliated by sending us a list of all the repairs that we had to make sure were completed before we moved out, which included a lot of small things, but also big things like:\n\n·       Spackling all holes in the walls and repainting\n\n·       Removing any modifications we had made, such as shelving units, guard rails, and the partitioned office we set up in the unfinished basement, complete with lighting and flooring and walls.\n\n·       Replacing the bedroom door that one of our kids broke – which was not a standard size, and would need to cut and sanded to fit the doorway\n\n·       Leaving the yard in the exact condition we found it in\n\n·       Fix the flooring in the bathroom that had mold build up underneath it\n\nThis last one was particularly irritating, because they flooring by the tub had not been properly sealed, so ANY amount of water on the floor was going to run under the floor and cause mold. In fact, the base sealing that ran around the entire bathroom outline was about 3 inches short of the length in needed to be in order to run flush with boarder of the floor, and whoever installed it decided to leave that 3-inch gap at the middle of the tub rather than some place unnoticeable, like in the closet. The landlords insisted that the mold was our fault and that the unfinished seal had nothing to do with it. Then they got angry when I pulled up the flooring to determine the amount of mold damage, because it meant the floor needed to be completely replaced. They acted like if I had carefully pealed it back I could clean the mold and put the exact flooring back down. This wasn’t stick on squares, this was a roll of linoleum flooring that was over 15 years old and had been glued down with professional grade adhesive. Reusing the same flooring was NOT an option, as it was brittle and breaking apart. He was also mad that I mentioned to one of the professionals who came to give a quote that there had been mold involved at all (this was after I had removed the adhesive and mold), and said I was ruining their chances of getting a cheap quote.\n\nAfter 3 different quotes for the bathroom floor, they refused to approve anyone, because every quote included needing to test for asbestos, which the landlord wasn’t confident would end in his favor. So, I told him I would do the work myself (I’ve put in flooring several times before, and I worked construction with my dad growing up, so I know what I’m doing). At this point, we only had 2 weeks left before we needed to be out. In the midst of all of this, my husband’s uncle passed away in a very traumatic and shocking event, and he ended up flying across the country to attend the funeral and be with his family. This left me alone with 3 kids to do all the repairs and finish moving into the new house. And in the meantime the landlords also insisted on approving all the materials I purchased to make the repairs in the home.\n\nWhile all this is happening, our neighbors were pissed at the landlords for pushing us out. We had really good relationships with all of them. One neighbor was like a grandma to my kids and was always baking them goodies and inviting them over to play with their dogs. The neighbors across the street would always sit on the porch and chat with us on summer evenings. We brought cookies to everyone on our block during holidays and made it a point to get to know everyone’s names and know their families. It was a REALLY tight community. Even before the landlords/owners turned nasty though, everyone told us how terrible they were, because they had lived in the house themselves and the neighbors all knew them. Before our family moved in, they landlords would only rent to people from their home country, who usually didn’t speak English, and didn’t like to interact with anyone else in the neighborhood. On several occasions the landlord admitted to neighbors that he did not want to rent to anyone who wasn’t like “his people” because it just didn’t feel right.  We were the first family who had rented that house that felt like an addition to the community rather than someone hiding from the community. When our neighborhood found out they had bullied us into moving, they were very upset.\n\nDuring the last week (the same time that my husband was gone for the funeral), I realized that I was way in over my head, and wasn’t going to be able to finish all these repairs and cleaning by myself. We reached out to the landlord and let him know that it would take us a few days past our lease to finish up the repairs, but that we were willing to do the work. He lost his mind. He told us that if he didn’t get the house back in the exact same condition it was in by midnight on the last day of our lease, that he would charge us an extra month of rent plus sue for damages because it would be time lost that he couldn’t rent it out to someone else. We reiterated that my husband was at a funeral, and they had just barely approved the work on the repairs and materials a few days earlier. His response was to \"kindly follow the contract\" or he would take legal action.\n\nSo, our neighborhood and church congregation came together and spent those last few days working on the house so that everything was fixed and in accordance with what the landlord demanded. One person painted, another person finished the flooring in the bathroom, one family had their kids come over to pull weeds, another guy brought tools to cut and sand the door to fit properly. EVERYONE agreed that all the repairs were things the landlord should be handling and shouldn’t be our responsibility to personally repair or even coordinate the repairs for. These were things that should be covered in a deposit. The landlord acted like he had someone ready to move in the moment we were out and that he was going to lose that contract if the house wasn’t ready. Spoiler alert, he didn’t.\n\nEven after we turned the keys over, the landlord wanted to nitpick and make us come back to fix small things, which we flat out refused and told him he could take it out of our deposit. 30 days after we moved, we received a bill from the landlord. He nickeled and dimed us out of every last cent of our deposit, despite all the repairs and work the entire community had done. Stupid claims like $150 to replace a window screen that had a hole in it, when I know he either wasn’t going to fix it at all, or just buy a $2 repair kit from Walmart. $800 for water damage to a kitchen drawer because there was some bubbling on the bottom, something that I know he was just going to put an insert on to cover it. He even cited damages that had been there since before we moved in, and he had himself charged us a service fee to fix several times, but the issue remained because he never properly fixed ANYTHING. His bill was in excess of $500 of our actual deposit. Some of it was to cover utility fees that I had already directly paid to the city. I sent receipts of my payment for the utilities and told him I was not paying him anymore money. If he wanted to withhold my entire deposit, so be it, but he wasn’t getting another dime out us. If he wanted to sue, go for it. We never heard from them again, but I was still pissed. My neighbors were still pissed. And we all wanted revenge, even if it’s petty.\n\nBecause the new house we moved into was only about 5 minutes away, my kids still went to the same school – the one that is 500 feet from the old house. I drive past it EVERY day taking my kids to and from school. And we also still go over just to visit neighbors. Here is what I found out from chatting with them:\n\nEvery time the landlords would bring someone in to show the house, the next-door grandma would make sure she or her husband were doing yardwork. They would make sure to strike up a conversation with the prospective tenants, and always mention how the last family who lived there was so wonderful, and it was really awful that they only reason we had moved away was because of how the landlords treated us.\n\nSomeone (I still don’t know who) took to knocking on the doors and windows at all hours or the night, which sent alarm notifications to the landlords. They started to keep his personal car parked in the driveway of this unoccupied house to deter break-ins.\n\nMy neighbor who liked to sit on the porch and chat with us in the evenings decided that anytime the landlord was doing landscaping work was a time my neighbor wanted to be enjoying his peace and quiet. He yelled at the landlord for making too much noise so often, that the landlord ended up buying all new landscaping equipment that was electric and specifically intended to reduce noise.\n\nThe house sat empty for 6 months before they got new renters. I watched the price move up and down on Zillow every month. At first, they tried to rent it out at $800 more than what we had been paying. Then it steadily dropped each month until they were asking nearly what our original rent was. Eventually they rented it out, and it was much cheaper than we had tried to negotiate them down to, which gave me great satisfaction. I found a way to introduce myself to the new family within the first a couple of weeks that they lived there. It was easy to spot them during school drop off and pick up times since they walked their kids to school. “Oh, you just moved in? We used to live there! The neighbors are so nice. I hope you don’t have too much trouble with the landlords!”\n\nAfter a little over a year of the new family living there I noticed a moving truck. I had done the math and knew that they were still in the middle of their lease. I decided to be super petty. I knocked on the door and reintroduced myself, and verified that they were moving. Then I unloaded everything the landlords did to us during our move out process, and how they screwed us out of thousands of dollars, even after we did all the repairs. I gave them pictures of our move out process so that if they landlords tried to charge them with certain damages, they could prove that it existed before they moved in. I gave them contact information for everyone who worked on the house before we had moved out so that they could have a timeline of all the damages that I’m certain the landlord would try to pin on them. They verified that the landlords had been unbearable, and were the main reason they were moving out. And once again the landlords had sent a laundry list of repairs the family was required to fix before moving. After our conversation, the husband told me he was going to inform the landlord that he would only do the cleaning and repairs if they landlord returned their entire deposit up front, otherwise he wasn’t going to do anything beyond removing his possessions from the property.  I’m assuming he didn’t get his deposit back, because a few weeks after they moved, I saw the landlord and his wife in front of the house. They had hired someone (not a professional) to clean up the yard, and they had set up an umbrella and chairs to shade them while they micromanaged the work this poor laborer was doing in the hot sun.\n\nThe house has sat empty for over a year now. According to our old neighbors, who we are still good friends with, they have only shown the house a couple of times. It’s both for sale and rent, at much cheaper than going rate, but no one wants it. As I understand, the neighbors still do what they can to harass them. Someone went back to knocking on doors and windows to set off the alarms, because the landlord has his car parked there 24/7 again. One neighbor also reported him to the city for blowing his leaves across the street into the park rather than bagging them himself, and I hope he got a hefty fine and lots of backpain every time he had to rake and bag his own leaves. Now it’s covered in snow, and because the house is so close to a school, they have to come over and ensure the walkways are salted and shoveled. It sure is a lot of extra work for a house that is empty and not bringing in any income. Every time I drive past to drop my kids off at school, I see that for sale sign and get the sweet satisfaction that they aren’t making any money on that house, and that they aren’t terrorizing anyone else.  \n\nAnd in case anyone is interested, the new house we moved into has the most amazing owner/landlord. They have never harassed us, they’ve fixed anything that’s gone wrong with the house without any complaint, and the only time they charged us anything beyond the agreed rent was when a bracket on the garage door broke because my kids left something in the way, and they asked us to cover the cost of the new bracket, which was less than $50. We’ve lived here nearly 4 years now, and love it.",

    "text": "Fun in the waterpark This happened last summer in an European city. Sorry for any mistakes, as English is not my natice language!\n\nOver here we have those big public outdoor pools. One weekend kind of a \"Pool Olympics\" were hosted in an outdoor pool. Basically it was all meant to be a fun family event: everybody could sign in with a team and then a couple of more or less funny games were played in the water. It was fun for the kids.\n\nOur team consisted of 5 persons: two 12-year-old girls, two 11-year-old boys and one mom. So they played, won a couple of preliminary games and then there comes the semi final: It was a race in the water, where one team member had to sit on a floating rubber flamingo and the other members pulled it across the pool and back. After a couple of races everybody noticed that one lane was sginificantly faster than the other. So did my kids.\n\nAs they were ready, they paced to the fast lane and reached it first. But, there comes Karen from the other team and pulls away the handle. The hosts, mainly students, did not notice anything. And for little kids it is hard to stand up for themselves against adults. So Karen and her family just occupied the flamingo. Karen was in a team with her husband and two boys of about 13-15 years. As strenght matters in this race, they probably would have won it anyway. But still...\n\nAfter the race my son was devastated and really, really mad and angry. Especially, because he and his friend reached the rubber flamingo first. I was not able to calm him down, as he is very competitive and cannot handle unjustice well. But wait, here comes the final...\n\nIn the grand final, the members of the two teams had to run across the pool, collect some things from the other side and run back outside of the water. A couple of times, until they collect everything. Funny thing is: the organizer handed out water guns to all the other participants. So as the finalists were running in and outside of the water, they were targeted by about 50 water guns!\n\nMy son did not want to participate. I told him, if I was you, I would go for Karen. He changed all of the sudden, had this look in his eyes and called up his friend. And yes, the race started and the two boys were only going for Karen! It was good to see their satisfaction. As Karen jogged back outside of the pool he hit her right in her head and laughed \"headshot\" to his friend. At the end, Karen was all exhausted.\n\nAnd yeah, it might be that I accidently stepped in Karen's way when she jogged back outside of the pool. And as she tried to avoid me, I did the same, but swerved to the wrong side. Then she changed sides and me too. And again. Oh, so unlucky. Oops, you lost a couple of seconds.\n\nOver motivated Karen did not win. Justice was served wet. And my son really enjoyed the final!",

    "text": "Refuse to let my dad go to his sister's wedding? I hope you like tough questions. Mods: politics mentioned but in a non specific or partisan way, I assume it is okay\n\nThis is a story from my dad during the era of mandatory service in the Belgian army. I apologize if I get any details wrong but this is 2nd hand and an older one by now. Game of telephone may apply.\n\nDuring his time in the army, my dad's sister got married. The army was required to allow soldiers to go on leave for these kinds of events (except I assume during emergencies). However, his commander apparently did not seem to care much for rules like that. During a military exercise, the commander expected my dad to be present and did not allow him to leave for his sister's wedding. My dad was pretty annoyed and so told my grandpa, who at the time was a politician. My grandpa was known to be a bit of a bulldog in politics in the way that he did not back down. The reason this fact is relevant is because of my grandpa's status as a politician he had contacts. Grandpa said he'd handle it.\n\nLong story short, the commander suddenly received a politely worded letter on his desk from the **Minister of Defense** asking for the reason for the refusal. According to my dad, the commander furiously called him into his office and stammered something along the lines of \"I will let you go to the wedding. I don't know how you pulled this off, but it will have consequences\". My dad played dumb for the rest of his time in the army. His commander never did punish him, nor did he bother him again. The commander never ended up knowing how that letter ended up on his desk.",

    "text": "Revenge for a broken toilet For about 5 and a half years, I saw a psychiatrist, \"Dr. Hag,\" who ended up being worse than useless. I even needed further help elsewhere to deal with her psychological damage. It's complicated, but one thing was clear enough: She seemed fine in the beginning, but had somehow eventually become a horrible, judgmental person. It took me way too long to finally stop seeing her.\n\nFor a stretch of time, as things were gradually going down the tubes with Dr. Hag, the single-bathroom toilet in her office space was broken. She and her office-mates could use the bathroom in the lobby of the adjacent building, but patients were out of luck. So I guess that's why no one working there had bothered to call a plumber... yet. For some reason, I'd usually suddenly have to go – badly – during our session, and during the time the toilet was broken, I'd have to leave early to use a Starbucks bathroom two or so blocks away. It's an absolute miracle that there wasn't an evil bathroom code lock on that door. I tried to change my appointment time to avoid this, but Dr. Hag refused to reschedule me. This went on for over a month, maybe close to two months.\n\nOne day, I had had enough. Dr. Hag's office toilet was still broken. This time, since the urge didn't strike until later in session, I managed to hold it in through the end. I left her office, sat down in the waiting room, waited for Dr. Hag's next client/victim to enter her office, waited another 10-15 seconds, and then went and took a monster shit in the broken toilet. I don't think I would have made it to the Starbucks bathroom anyway. There was water in the toilet, so it looked normal, but it wouldn't flush, so someone could have easily not known it was broken.\n\nI guess this led someone to finally call a damned plumber, because when I went back the following week, the toilet was fixed. She never asked if it was me; maybe because I made it look like another client could have done it. I hope my petty revenge stunk up the waiting room.",

    "text": "I faked a haunting when i was 12 To preface, i’m the youngest of 3, at the time i was f12, and the oldest child was f15. She was going through a phase of teen angst and was really a terror to be around, so i retaliated whenever i could in secret, even going as far as gluing all her items down to her dresser with super glue after she was mean to me (i don’t remember exactly what happened unfortunately) but For example, she had candles, glued down and glued shut, perfumes glued down and glued shut, even her deodorant was glued down to the dresser and glued shut. Funniest thing is, my parents were also getting aggravated with her so they didn’t even ground me for it, but they did ground me for lying about it when i was confronted by them. \n\nNow to get to the story, we had a family friend pass away abruptly and prior she had been staying with us. She didn’t get along the best with my sister as she was again rude to her but sister was still upset after she passed. We’ll call the family member Mary for easier context. Mary was in her last trimester of pregnancy the first few months she was with us, and ended up having her baby and staying with us a bit after until some things happened and she moved out. She was notorious for drinking diet coke, and LOVEDDD lemon pepper seasonings. She put it on everything while pregnant and drank around a 2liter of diet coke daily. this will give context later.\n\nFast forward a few months after she passed away and My sister had been giving me crap about something, again i can’t remember what it was but i was pissed. She had stashed some chips in her room so i took them when she wasn’t home and coated them in Cayenne pepper. Around a week later she asked me if the chips smelled like lemon pepper seasoning to her and that’s when i got the idea. i agreed and said they definitely had been coated in lemon pepper and that’s odd, and made a joke that Mary was getting revenge for all the times sister was rude to her. \n\nafter a few days sister was again being a terror and stormed out of the house. i got another idea. Mary’s room hadn’t been fully cleaned out yet so i found some half drank diet coke 2 liters and shoved them under her bed, one in her closet, and one in her dresser to really seal the deal. \n\nThe next day she found the one in her dresser and FREAKED out, thinking Mary was haunting her. a few days passed and she found the one in her closet and again freaked out about it. Finally after a month or two when things calmed down, she cleaned her room and Behold: the diet coke stash under her bed. At this point she was petrified that Mary was coming back to haunt her because of how she treated her, even tried to convince my mom we needed to hire a priest. After that i figured i’d relax with the Mary pranks because i was starting to feel bad about it. \n\nTo this day i don’t think i’ve ever actually told her the truth behind it but she also could’ve forgotten it even happened by now. My mom was eventually told by me what happened and she was mad at me at first but came around and laughed it off sooner or later. I don’t think my sister uses this reddit forum but incase she does, I’m sorry and so is Mary.",

    "text": "How about you don't try to ruin someone's day? I don't know if this is the right subreddit because I was not the giver of the revenge, it was a deity looking over me, but I reaped all the glory. I saw a car down the street that reminded me of this story.\n\nIt happened around 12 years ago. I (29M, then 16) was going home in the rain with my friends from school. As you know, teenagers are a bunch of chaotic gremlins that cause mayhem when in groups. They walk in the rain, sing loud when having fun, climb trees, etc.\n\nThis particular afternoon wasn't raining hard, it was falling droplets, so we didn't require an umbrella. The curbs, however, were drowning with the amount of water running down those street drains.\n\nThen it comes a car. The streets were large enough to fill with two cars side by side, and even a third, so this car didn't need to even touch the curb water, but this dude swerved out of his way to drench us. And I mean it, he wanted us to evolve back into fish with the speed he picked up. As soon as we saw the dude accelerating, we grabbed whoever was not paying attention and pushed near the wall, because we thought he was gonna hit us, not splashing some dirty water.\n\nMy particular group of friends always kept to ourselves and made fun of each other, not outsiders. I think this is what God or another higher being used to apply judgement in that situation. I remember thinking about my dog waiting for me at home while I held one of my friends in front of me with my back turned to the car. Suddenly, a really loud 'clunk' noise and a little water splashed my butt (either that of I shat myself, hard to remember). We looked back, and the car was standing next to us, smoke coming from the tires (I think? Either there or somewhere else) and the lower front of the fender caved in.\n\nWe were saved from this particular tsunami thanks to our city inferior infrastructure. Water drainage was a problem in some places, so people used to put stuff in drains to prevent leaves and things from blocking the water. This time was a metal rod sticking out of the drain. The impact caused the rod to break in half, not before reshaping dude's fender and cracking the pavement.\n\nWhen we saw that, my friends made sure to try and humiliate the man by [pointing and laughing](https://giphy.com/gifs/simpsons-nelson-the-UU1bHu6QWyFxZM63Jh) so theatrically loud that we almost forgot the fear we felt. Dude was pissed, but what was he gonna do? Beat a buncha kids? The impact site was fixed not too long ago, but the lesson we all got was: Don't be an asshole in the rain, and don't try to screw a bunch of teens minding their business.",

    "text": "Dressed down so I stood up I worked in an office where they promoted a very new, unexperienced, unqualified, suckup from an entry level guy to a team lead. One of three under the manager. There were roughly 30 people on the team. HR rules stated that he wasn't allowed to apply due to having been at the company &lt; 1 year, had zero leadership experience, etc, etc. Grievances were filed with HR and dropped despite multiple, fully qualified individuals with spotless records being in the running. \n\nHe was known to be a suckup, and wasn't really liked prior to his promotion. After the promotion he was wildly hate.. Apart from a couple sycophants. Quite entertaining, in retrospect, how people will degrade themselves for the barest scraps of power... \n\nAnyways, middle management knew he was reviled and told him he had to find a way to get people to like him. His solution was \"not required but you should think of them as required\" happy hours every month. For the first one, most everyone felt like they had to go and started figuring out how to fit it into their schedule. Some of these people had an hour drive each way and were finding sitters for their kids. These people were terrified they would lose their jobs if they missed drinking a few beers with the boss. (I should note that he has roped in everyone under the manager, I'm not even technically under this guy)  \n  \nI knew my rights and declined the invite. He comes by my cube a few times and the day of to try to pressure me into being there. Dude, there is no way I'm spending my free time with work people. You can either keep me on the clock or you can't ask me to be there, I know my rights. (I liked my team members well enough, had been to parties at their houses, etc, but I'm not going out with the Team Lead under any circumstances) Team Lead did not like that, and walked away in a huff.\n\nNext day everyone comes in and everyone is pretending like they had fun when it's very clear they're just trying to get away from Team Lead's attempts at chumming with them. Around 10 we have a standup and he talks about how great it was to have everyone at the thing. Then he singles me out, talks about how anti-social I am, and how management notices when people aren't team players. Don't skip required events, etc.\n\nLOL, okay dude.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I email the entire team \"Hey all, &lt;team member&gt; asked me about required after work events that are unpaid so I figured i'd share with everyone. State statute &lt;blah&gt; says that for hourly employees like us that we can't be required to go to these sorts of things without being on the clock. So if you can't find a sitter and can't make it, you don't need to worry at all\"\n\nTotally friendly, totally non-confrontational. Totally effective. Team Lead sat by himself at the bar for the next two \"required but not required\" happy hours and had to find another way to force people to like him.",

My first car was a Chevy Aveo, a little putt-putt car that I could fill up for maybe $20, and I beat that car into the ground because I bought it brand new and fully paid it off. At the end of its life, it was missing door handles, the gas door cover, you name it. \n\nA few days before I was gonna sell it to one of those Cash4Cars dealers, I happened to get in a little scuttle with a woman in a parking lot, because she parked SO close to my passenger side door that she dented it when she got out and got her red paint on the side mirror she also cracked. She was very heavy set, so I know she was leaning into her door when she got out, hence the damage. \n\nI was literally sitting in the car as she did it. At first I was polite and said something like \"maam, you just dented my car with your door, we should exchange insurance please.\" \n\nAnd she just kept walking away, like she did nothing, kept ignoring me calling her out as she waddled away, and I know she was ignoring me, because she kept looking back at me and waving me off.  \n\nWell that didnt fly with me, so I followed her in the store ready for a showdown, but instead I found one of those sticker machines for like $0.50 with the ugliest stickers you can imagine. I bought a bunch and just went to town sticking them all over her car, the windshield, and especially her driver side door. \n\nMoved my car over about three rows and parked between some other cars, because I wanted to see her face when she saw the stickers. I was probably waiting like half an hour, but it was worth it. She was cussing and throwing the biggest hissy fit of her life as she walked around her car finding sticker after sticker.\n\nIdc if my car looked beat up, its not an invitation to damage it further and not take accountability for it.",

    "text": "I'll help you advance your career as much as I can! I live and work in the UK for 10 years now. I'm from - let's say - country A. Used to work with a bloke from country B.  \nHe wasn't necessarily a bad guy, but he had a very weird *sense of humor.* Our countries aren't really friendly to each other and while I couldn't care less, he definitely brought that here with him. I was constantly a target of his jokes about why my country sucks (it does, but not for the reasons he thinks...) and the only nice thing about us are the girls he loves to... you know... because that's what his country would do to mine too.  \nAnd of course, he has nothing against me, he likes me, it's just that my nationality is what it is.\n\nWhen I left that workplace because I moved away, I was happy I'll never see him again. New town, new job, happy days, right?  \nRight...\n\nI was working at my new place for 4 months when I've got promoted to my current position, but that also involved moving to a different unit, where I - you guessed it - ran into this guy again. I was friendly towards him (I don't really hold grudges), especially since I just became his assistant team leader, and I didn't want to start my new role by having one against someone in my team.  \nHe wasn't happy. He wanted this job and he felt that I stole it from him, even though I was promoted out of blue; I never applied for the position, I didn't even know it exists, I was told on a Thurusday that \"That's what you gonna do from next Monday.\".\n\nAs the weeks went by and I learnt more and more about the work the unit does, I started to notice small mistakes in people's job, including his. I looked at it as an opportunity to learn how to lead and my boss was over the moon that I want to handle these small things on my own (that's why they promoted me though...), so I went around, talked to people, showed them the stuff I've seen, asked them if there's any way to avoid these mistakes or it's something to do with the material/machines/etc (they've had years of experience, I was there for a few weeks...), I tried not to blame anyone unless it was obviously a human error. I wanted to learn, not to criticize.  \nWhen I approaced him the first time, before I even had a chance to explain what's wrong with the stuff he's done, he tried to start an argument about why it isn't his fault (didn't say it was...) and how it's the company's fault if they promote people without having any experience on the job whatsoever. I couldn't fault him there, I didn't have much experience, but I wasn't promoted because I'm good on the shop floor, I was promoted because I think ahead and solve issues before they become problems, and that's an invaluable skill in the unit they sent me to.\n\nAnyway, the first few weeks trying to work with him was, let's just say, difficult.  \nUntil my old unit started to lag behind and they asked my boss for a few people to help them out. My boss thought it's another great opportunity to learn to lead, and he let me choose the people we send over. Now I knew that the job in my old unit sucks. It's hard work, it's noisy, it's hot, it just sucks, but it has one great benefit; it's full of team leaders and managers, and if you want to get a permanent contract, it's the best place to get it. I've got mine there. My *old friend* however*,* was still with the agency. Now how am I to take this great opportunity, to let him shine, away from him?  \nSo it took me less than a minute to make up the list. He was on the top of it.  \nHe was fucking furious. He knew that job sucks too, but I told him it'll definitely help him advance his career. He can show the gaffers how incredibly great he is at his job, and can secure a contract just as quickly as I did. Don't let it slip away, he can only win!\n\nHis life was hell for the next few weeks, and every single day I went over to my old unit (that's where the head office was, I had to turn in paperwork every morning) he looked at me like I killed his cat or something. I always smiled and waved at him, because - again - I don't hold grudges, right?  \nAnd then, a few weeks later, they offered me another position, which while sounded good on paper, was an absolutely horrible job in practice. I respectfully declined, but recommended him, because - again - who am I to stop someone to advance their career?  \nThey told me there's no chance that guy will ever even get a contract with the company, let alone getting any position whatsoever; he makes way too many mistakes, he's lazy, he's annoying, he's inappropriate towards other people, he can't work with anyone, and they're happy we sent him down there because they wouldn't want to pay *someone like him* any longer than necessary, but if he'd stay with us they'd never knew.\n\nBut hey, I tried to help. Really, really tried.",

    "text": "Hiroshima Museum I was in the Hiroshima A-bomb museum today.\n\nThe main museum experience is a walk down a few rooms where you see images of the victims, records, clothing etc. saved from the Hiroshima bombing. It's a very sad and cathartic experience imo. There's this story of a child that survived the bombing but still died of cancer as a 12 year old girl. The museum doesn't point fingers at any nation or people, it just shows the horrors of war that the civilian population experiences and urges peace and negotiation instead of violence.\n\nAt the end of the walk there is a \"journal\" where visitors are welcome to write down their thoughts, right after what they had just witnessed.  I was flipping through the pages -- everyone talks about peace, prayers, no war. And as I'm looking through the pages, a tourist stops by and asks \"hey are you gonna write something? You mind if I go first real fast?\" I actually did intend to take more time to think so why not. They started writing something down, took like 5 minutes...they appeared to be a short, Pilipino  guy, approximately in their 20s. He suddenly asked me where I'm from and I said \"California\", he responded \"Me too! I am from LA, but my family is Pilipino\". Ok well that's cool - I said. He then proceeded to ask me where I am \"really\" from since I have a slight accent. I said \"Oh yeah my fam is from X but I don't really speak their language\", the guy made a some smirky remark, something about \"well you're Americanized, I speak the language of my parents\". Ok now I felt bad letting them cut in front of me but whatever, they finished writing.\n\nAs they finished writing and left, I came to the journals and looked at what he had written. I was shocked. Mind you ALL the thoughts are about peace, how sad the coming is, how Hiroshima must never repeat itself. Which makes sense after what you see in the museum.\n\nThey had written \"You had it coming, WE won and you lost! Suck it. - Signed USA AF Pilot\".\n\nFirst of all  - ain't no way in hell that shawty is eligible to serve in the armed forces. Second - who \"we\"? The guy said he's Pilipino living in LA.\n\nThird - what the fuck?!\n\nWell I am not letting this bitch tarnish such a beautiful museum! I scribbled over their hateful words 3 times to make sure no one in that museum -- looking at the journals right after seeing the horrific images of dead children -- had to see such insults.\n\nPeople like this guy make me sick.\n\nIt happened today.",

    "text": "I'm smarter than you Ricky Back in school there was this one kid in my class who always had to be the center of attention, his name was Ricky. (There's always a Ricky.)\n\nOne afternoon in English class Ricky was sat behind me. Ricky wasn't exactly... academically inclined, and so on this afternoon Ricky had decided that his entertainment was going to consist of him kicking the back of my chair at random intervals. I just ignored it for a while but near the end of the lesson my patience finally snapped and I turned around and gave Ricky the middle finger. Immediately, Ricky started pointing at me and yelling at our teacher, \"Sir, sir he swore at me, he swore at me.\"\n\nNow, there's two things you need to know: Firstly this was a Christian school in the mid 1990s, swearing was a big deal. Secondly, in the UK there used to be two different ways of \"giving the finger\". One was the middle finger and the other was raising the index finger as well in a V shape.\n\nAnyway, the teacher comes over to investigate Ricky's yelling, he looks over at me and I immediately deny everything. The teacher sighs and asks me to follow him out of the room. Once in the hallway he turns to me and asks again if I swore at Ricky, I continue my denials. Then he says, \"Okay, but if you were going to give somebody the finger, how would you do it?\"\n\n\"Well sir, I don't really know.\" I reply (please note at this point that butter wouldn't melt in my lying mouth), \"But if I was forced to, I guess...\" at this point I \"reluctantly\" perform the 2 fingered version for my teacher, (please note, this is not the 1 fingered version I'd actually used).\n\nThe teacher nods and sends me back into the classroom before calling Ricky out instead. I didn't get to hear that conversation but I can only assume that Ricky was asked to describe how I gave him the middle finger and that his answer was inconsistent with my own. After a couple of minutes, an extremely unhappy Ricky was forced to come back into the class and apologise to both myself and the whole class for causing disruption. How I managed to keep the smirk of my face, I'll never know.",

    "text": "Gave my friend's boyfriend HER phone # when he hit on me at a club Years before everyone had a cell phone, I was at a club. I noticed my friend's boyfriend from numerous photos. I knew he cheated on her. She caught him once and she forgave him. I can't stand this guy, even though I had never met him in person -until now.  So, he notices me and starts flirting with me. I gave him a fake name and pretended to flirt back a little bit.  He ultimately asked me for my phone number. I took a napkin (that's how we did it in the old days) and wrote my fake name and his real girlfriends phone number on a napkin.\n\nI guess he was tipsy because he didn't recognize the phone number. Later that night, he called and asked for \"Jill\" not my friend's name. She shared the story with me and I didn't fess up in the moment. She broke up with him soon after that.  A few months later, she met the most amazing man, who she ended up marrying. I broke the news to her then. She was grateful and actually thought it was hilarious.\n\n  \nEdit: To those doubting we did not have cell phones then. A few select people did, they were bigger than showboxes and I don't think they stored phone numbers. We also did have photographs.  \n\nHe was extremely handsome and tall. Thinking back, I was 90% sure it was him when I spotted him. When he introduced himself and the name matched, then I was certain it was him.\n\nNever did I imagine him calling. I thought he would recognize the number and know he had been caught.  He was a womanizer and drunk, or at least tipsy, hence not recognizing the number. Thank goodness he called. otherwise he might have been on good behavior for a couple of months and she might have missed out on the love of her life.",

The family who owned were kind, and not rolling in the dough. Definitely a community, quality before profits kind of place. The store had been around for generations/ long before the lofts were built on the street behind us.The recieving dock was on this street, so we got early morning deliveries. Despite it being a bit noisy , we always tried to keep the volume down and we never got complaints until this one entitled NIMBY loft dweller. He would come over to the bakery trucks and yell at them for  their \"loud clanking of bread carts!\" Later I found out he was blackmailing them / threatening to call in a noise complaint unless he got fresh bread/ or a treat.\nOne day I noticed him get out of his car ,a Volkswagon Jetta, to complain. He had a for sale sticker with his phone number, which I took down. I flyered the neighborhood with his at least 10,000 car for sale for 100 dollars ( looking for a quick sale! call me anytime!). I also was one of the many people who would call him/ then argue and complain about not being able to buy it for 100 bucks. He screamed, I am so sick of getting these calls!! Of course I gave his number to the bakery trucks. Eventually the guy dissappeared/ but I still called about the car every once in awhile years later.",

But it was definitely petty and had an incredibly satisfying outcome. \n\nWhile in college, I had the loudest neighbor. And our walls weren’t even particularly thin, I never heard any other neighbors. She exclusively took all her calls on speaker phone and shouted everything she said. (She also played the recorder…are there seriously college classes teaching the recorder?! WTF?) To say that she drove me absolutely insane was an understatement. \n\nOne day I overheard her on the phone with her mother, absolutely losing it because her vag was super itchy, asking for advice for relief and whether or not she needed to go see her doctor. As luck would have it I was getting ready to go grocery shopping when I overheard all this and decided to pick her up some Vagisil. Left a note that says “hope this helps! Also, you may want to stop taking all your calls on speakerphone.” \n\nApparently that was all it took for her to find her indoor voice. I never heard another word out of her!

Woman around my age who had just moved back to the city from the West Coast met with me about an empty room in my place. She said she wanted to try a \"new neighborhood\" (Park Slope for anyone familiar) and she thought my place was cute, etc. Great. Tedious roommate interview process over. Or so I thought. \n\nMaybe a week and a half later, I get a text from her saying that she \"just misses \\[her old neighborhood\\] Williamsburg too much\"; that she'll be moving out at the end of the week and since she was only there for half a month, she would be \"prorating the rent.\" She also wound up bailing on utilities as well. \n\nA couple of months later, she butt dials me. This was the era where most phone plans didn't have unlimited minutes. Now her minutes were going to get really limited. I left my phone in my room and proceeded to go do errands for a couple of hours. I come back and the phone call is still on. I go and take a bath, complete with drinking tea, listening to soft music and fizzy spa salts. Phone call still on an hour later. I go and read on my bed and either she hung up or the call dropped maybe 45 minutes later. The 225 minutes of talk time was probably worth a whole lot less than half a month's rent but at least it was likely a pain in the ass to deal with AT&amp;T or Verizon or whatever during that next billing cycle. \n\nThe chick who wound up taking her space lowered the roommate bar even more, after which I wound up getting my own place.",

I asked if I could bring a friend, older man in his 70's with no family and she said, \"no, let's just keep it family.\" \n\nThis really upset me for some reason - I think because I believe Thanksgiving should be about kindness and inclusion.

Pie is her thing and she always makes 5-7 different flavors and a cake will mess up the aesthetic. 2) this is the best cake in town and I figured some people (at least me) would only eat the cake and snub her pies. \n\nWhen I walked in, everyone asked what I brought and were excited about the cake. Grandma was speechless and just looked at it for 30 seconds, which was all I needed to feel good about her exclusivity. \n\nPlot twist: she asked to keep the last slice when I was packing up. I guess she heard people talking about how good it was and wanted to try it. So I guess it worked out for everyone!",

I used to have this neighbor who treated my tool collection like his personal rental service; except the part where you actually return the stuff.

That tool vanished into the void forever.\n\nGranted I should have handled this better, but a few days later, to make this end, I asked to borrow his lawn mower. I made the excuse I always let you borrow my tools. I used it and put it back exactly where it belonged. I just “forgot” to return the keys. \nWhen he came over the next day demanding them back ( granted I was always friendly when asking for my stuff back ) “Oh! I remembered last night. I left them with Jimmy.

I tell my grandma I'm going to go back to the produce section and hurry off. I find his cart quickly because he had a lot of water stacked in it.

A few months ago, I started looking for a new job because of the poor team dynamics and lack of listening. A few weeks ago, I accepted a new position at a competing company. During my last two weeks, I was pulled into meeting’s to share all my knowledge about the systems I supported. They tried to ask me questions, but by the end of each meeting, they looked like deer in headlights. The best part was the last meeting, when the team lead said, “We’re screwed.” I laughed and said, “Well, you wouldn’t listen to me six months ago when I tried to tell you this.” Oh well.",

    "text": "Queue jumpers drop money. A few years ago at Rome airport we were approaching a coffee kiosk when two tall Italian lads (in their 20s) strode up talking loudly and laughing and totally ignoring us. My wife joined the queue but stood back about three feet from the person in front. These two lads then strode across and inserted themselves in front of my wife, still talking loudly, and completely ignoring the fact that she was there. I stepped up beside my wife to reinforce her presence but they continued to blank us and one took out his wallet and fished out some money. While doing this a note dropped to the ground. As he seemed to be oblivious to anything lower than his eye level he did not notice this. Nor did anyone else including my wife who was too busy fuming. Now normally I would pick up the money and offer it to the person that dropped it. That is how I was brought up. But as they had annoyed me I just stepped forward and put my foot on top of it.\n\nThey got served and left, my wife took her turn up at the kiosk and returned with the goods. She commented on the rudeness of these two at which point I said, Oh well never mind, maybe this 50 euro note that they dropped will make you feel better.",

    "text": "Guy kept cutting in line at the coffee shop, so I made his morning routine miserable There's a coffee shop I go to every morning before work. Small place, usually has a line of 5-6 people. There's this one guy who would show up, see the line, and then pretend to \"just remember\" he needed to ask the barista a question. He'd walk up to the counter, ask something stupid like what size the medium is, and then conveniently just order while he was already up there.\n\nHe did this at least four times that I witnessed. Nobody ever called him out because, you know, confrontation before coffee isn't worth it.\n\nSo I started playing the same game. Whenever I'd see him walk in and start heading toward the counter with his \"I have a question\" routine, I'd quickly step out of line and beat him to it. Then I'd ask the most annoying, time-consuming questions possible.\n\n\"What's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino again?\"\n\n\"Do you have oat milk? What about almond? Soy? Which one froths better?\"\n\n\"Can you explain your whole pastry selection?\"\n\nAnd then I'd say \"Oh actually, let me get back in line and think about it\" and go back to my spot. He'd be stuck standing there looking like an idiot.\n\nAfter about a week of this, he started just waiting in line like a normal person. Problem solved. Haven't seen him try to cut since.",

All of our roommates were reading while one guy was playing songs on his phone out loud. \n\nHe had a touch phone at that time and we had to depend on him to watch movies. It was so long back where we had to download pirated versions of songs with 10mb topups. He had a great collection of songs, movies and of course porn so no one argued or talked back to him. \n\nI got fed up and started a fight that he is disturbing everyone. He gave a vague reply and continued his nonsense. I looked towards everyone and I got no support. I went outside and continued my preparation. But at night I couldn't sleep because of the grudge. \n\nI knew his memory card was used by all guys to watch porn as he was the only one who could pirate it. At night while everyone was sleeping i took his phone outside and took out his memory card and put it back at same spot. \n\nI hid it inside the waistband of my shorts as I knew he would search everywhere. The next morning, he asked the usual boys who regularly takes the card, he searched everywhere, every corner of the room. I even helped him search. The whole room were frustrated as that was the only stress relief we had.\n\nI was having an evil laugh on inside for the whole day as everyone was searching for it and it was in my waistband the whole time. \n\nI felt bad the next day and thought of giving him back and apologize. But, he was soo pissed off and the boys were also angry about it so I never gave him back. The next day I felt really bad and threw it outside the window and gave him a vague clue. He went there and searched but he couldnt find it beneath all the leaves and trash and eventually gave up. \n\nI'm still friends with him but he doesn't know it was me even now. Should I tell him or let it be buried?",

    "text": "Right In The Face This was a long while ago in elementary school during summer break going into 3rd or 4th grade (I don’t remember). During the summer, I attended this program where we played different sports all day.\n\nThere was this girl who would always snicker or be like “ha ha” every time I’d miss throwing a ball, missing a goal, etc. It was hella frustrating. Mind you, I really didn’t like messing up or losing at that time so that girl was essentially putting salt in the wound.\n\nOne day I had enough so I had planned to throw a dodgeball right in the face of this girl. Once I saw that opportunity, I channeled as much power as I could and threw it right in her face in the middle of the gym. Not only did it hurt her, but I think I broke her glasses. \n\nThe fact no one caught me doing that is crazy. I lucked out big time. \n\nSo when the instructors finally saw that she was hurt and asked who did it, I said nothing. I was also hella nervous for getting in trouble. The instructors made every single person stop the game to high five her and apologize. I wasn’t sorry at all.\n\nI find this story to be kind of funny because I’m not or never was a vengeful person like that, but at that moment something snapped. Something inside of me.",

When I was 17, my best friend and I both earned our Eagle Scout award around the same time. It’s common practice to have a banquet dinner to celebrate the achievement, and since we were best friends and completed our projects around the same time, we opted to have one joint celebration. It was a nice potluck style dinner with all of the scouts and their families.\n\nLater in the evening, my best friend noticed I had the last homemade chocolate chip cookie on my plate. These were made by one of the scout's mothers and were highly prized because they were amazing. He asked me if I was going to eat it and I said yes. He licked his finger and wiped it on the top of the cookie and asked if I still wanted it. I said \"fine you can have it\" and licked the bottom of the cookie and set it on his plate. \n\nEdit: *two. I use voice dictation and AI has made it worse than ever and I don’t always catch the errors.",

    "text": "You've got mail... When my girlfriend and I first moved in together, we were meticulous in updating our mailing address for all of the places that sent us mail. The tenant that lived here previously, well he wasn't nearly as thorough. Almost immediately, we began to receive mail addressed him. Mail from his bank, government agencies, and half a dozen other companies was all getting delivered to us.\n\nThe first few of his letters we received, I did the responsible thing, wrote \"return to sender, recipient moved\" on the envelopes and put them back in the mail. After a month of continuing to receive his mail, I just started tossing them directly in the trash. I figured if he can't be bothered to update his address, I shouldn't be bothered to send it back. And so was the status quo for the next 3 years.\n\nThe frequency of the misdirected mail slowly decreased as time went on, but every month or two we would get something with his name on it and directly into the trash it would go. That all changed when one very peculiar letter landed in our mailbox, a birthday card.  Up until now, I had refrained from opening any of this guys mail, but curiosity got the better of me and I opened the birthday card.\n\nInside the card was a lovely note from this guys parents, and a cheque. In my part of the world personal cheques have the contact information of the account holder on them, so I called his mom. I was polite, and let them know that their son had moved out nearly nearly 4 years ago, and that i was tossing the card &amp; cheque in the trash.\n\nI like to imagine that the guy got chewed out by his parents for not giving them an updated mailing address, because we haven't received any more of his mail since then.",

    "text": "Enjoy your \"free\" smart home devices Posted originally on r/maliciouscompliance but I think it deserves a place here. I tried the official cross-post button but that didn't work so I just copied.\n\nSo here's the deal. I'd built a collection of smart home devices over a few years before we decided to move to a different state - most of which were smart switches on the wall. I'm kind of a nerd, so my smart home setup is not simple and requires some tinkering. For example, I had some devices set up to not reach the cloud and could only be controlled through my home PC, so they were basically unusable once my home computer was off the network - same with the front door camera doorbell. I set them up that way to automate the devices and build some scenes. I also had to use special equipment to load non-standard firmware, which once done, you couldn't use the normal app to set it up.\n\nA few years ago we put our house up for sale in the crazy seller's market and got an offer right away. I mentioned to the buyers, who were actually pretty friendly at the time, that I would be taking my smart home equipment since it's all set up in a specific way that would probably not work for them - no objections. That, however, was not mentioned explicitly in the contract (yes, that's my fault). As the closing date was approaching, I asked the buyers if they just wanted to buy the bundle already set up and ready to go, and that I would take the time to reprogram all the devices so they're ready to set up the standard way using their smartphones. I also told them I'd be available to help set up every single device if needed. Otherwise, I was planning on taking all the devices. The buyers decided to complain to their car-salesman-type lawyer, who then complained to my lawyer that I'm breaking the contract by taking switches that are on the wall. My lawyer try to explain that I would be doing them a favor taking the stuff off the wall since it would all be unusable once my computer is off the network and it would take special equipment to program back to a usable state. Their \"lawyer\" didn't budge. Mine said they were being unreasonable and asked if I had any attachment to those devices. Well, I didn't. And honestly they weren't that expensive - I just didn't want to go through the setup all over again.\n\nWell then, I complied. I left all the switches in the wall but I thought to have fun with it. Since they were still mine until closing day, I decided to check out a bunch of new features on the switches. One feature is a built-in schedule that doesn't require any network. SCORE! I set up the entertainment room lights to turn on at full brightness randomly at night, you know, around the time people usually watch movies. I also set up the smart switch in the bedroom to turn the ceiling lights and fan off and on randomly at night. I also had set up nice cabinet lights in the kitchen and bought a separate WiFi controller to replace the original not so smart controller. That wasn't in the wall, so technically the contract said it was mine to take - and I did.\n\nIt was petty, I know, but if the contract is your leverage, it can be mine mine also.",

I am a solution oriented person so I thought maybe I can drown out the noise with fan noise and ear buds. However, I kept hearing the bass through the wall and the ear buds were uncomfortable to sleep in. So I send the guy a text saying that I can hear his music and if he can please lower the volume. He complies and I don’t hear anything else that night. Solution solved between two adults right? Wrong. A day or two would pass and I would hear his music again. At this point my patience is diminished and the gloves are off. I grab my Alexa speaker, and set it to the max volume. I press it against the wall between our bedrooms and blast Rage Against The Machine. The music coming through my speaker is so loud I can hear it in every room in my apartment and I know my neighbor can hear it because after I turn off my music their is no more thumping sound coming from his apartment. I do this every time I hear music coming from his place. It has been my saving grace.",

It seems like right now Mike Johnson is betting pretty hard on letting the subsidies totally expire and moving to the HSA plan, however more centrist republicans are breaking ranks and endorsing either a total extension of them or imposing an income limit for the subsidies (I've heard 7x FPL) as well as things like work requirements. \n\nI personally think that a more conservative extension, like 5x FPL limit (78K for an individual + 26K for each other household member) makes the most sense but would like to hear everyone's else's opinion on this.\n\nThis would cover around the bottom 70% of Americans but I could definitely see an argument for 6X, although the 7x limit is definitely too high as this is 110K for an individual plus 40K for each member which means it would add already rich individuals (would add in an extra 10% of Americans, meaning only the top 20% will have to pay the full insurance cost)",

And from what I'm understanding most all of it went to Somalia.\n\nNow there are 3 democrats deep into this, Keith Ellison, Tim Waltz and Illian Ohmar. Now the democrats will have you believe that those 3 had no idea this was happening. Sorry I'm going to have to throw a great big 10 x 20 foot bullshit flag on that. A couple hundred thousand? Yeah I can see that flying under the radar, but 8 billion dollars? Oh hell no. What's really concerning to me is that Tim Walz almost became our V.P.. Now lets say your running for President, that's the highest office you can hold in the US. Are you not going to check out your VP pick 6 ways from Sunday, are you not going to pick apart every aspect of their life? There is no way you want minisual detail from 20 years ago in their past fucking up your campaign. Which means that Kamala HAD to have known about all this or she had a very incompetent staff. I'm going to go with, she knew.",

    "text": "It don't think the country will ever reunite I have one of those liberal friends that is still willing to talk to me. And I asked her a question the other day, and her answer was pretty concerning and I think it's a similar answer to what a lot of liberals would say. \n\nShe doesn't engage on the internet she's not the type to be a radical she doesn't trust most mainstream news networks but she definitely has been indoctrinated by enough of them to have severe TDS. So I try to avoid talking about Trump in general and I try to avoid emotional conversations like abortion or LGBT issues etc. \n\nSo we were talking about crime, And she goes on her pre-rehearsed rant about how crime is because of poverty or drug use which is tied to poverty or mental health and that's why we need more rehabilitation and less prisons etc. So I made kind of a normal argument pretty standard to what most conservatives would I think. But I added another factor because one of the things that is becoming a more common problem is young teenagers ages 12 to 17 are being recruited because if they go commit a murder or other type of serious crime they get more leniency and reduced sentences. And I think just cracking down on gang violence would protect the next generation from these monsters. \n\nAnyway the question I asked was \"hypothetically if there was a scenario where we learned that irrefutably focusing on rehabilitation simply didn't work, would you eventually concede this world view and try it my way?\" She beat around the bush saying it might need tweaks to work and it would take time and blah blah blah. So I said, \"if you had a magic lamp and could implement all the policies you believe would help with this issue whether it be addressing income inequality or the housing crisis or whatever. And no matter what you tried nothing was reducing crime would you eventually try it my way?\"\n\nThe short answer was no, And the reason this is so concerning to me is that these people care more about their worldview than they do about the victims and they aren't ever going to be willing to prioritize the victims unless they can also implement their worldview to do so. They simply can't acknowledge that they can be wrong about their ideas and to me that means they will simply get more desperate to make it work until they inevitably become radicals. It's anti-democracy at its core, The entire principle of democracy is that you're supposed to be able to vote for what you think will work and if it doesn't work you're supposed to be able to reconsider and vote for something else. The idea that they just can't possibly consider a different world view besides the blank slate theory is wild to me. \n\nI know that they can make the same argument about us of course and I would argue that I've changed my opinion of stance on multiple things based on new information. There's only a few world views that I would not reconsider but those are generally civil rights. I'm not going to suddenly have my mind changed on racial discrimination or removing the first Amendment. But as far as simple policies what's the point of continuing the same tactic regardless of results? And how can we possibly find common ground if they simply can't reconsider positions or open their mind to even hearing the other side?",

She started seeing this guy a few months back, and they’re pretty serious. We all moved in together a couple of months ago, but slowly her now fiancé “Mark” has been over more and more. They got engaged over a month ago. He’ll stay a bit in the morning when Gabby leaves for work and then come back in the evening when she comes back.\n\nHe tends to be over 4-5 days a week, and some of those days he sleeps over. We pay for gas and electric, so Anna and I had a plan to go over utilities and how they’re split. I got a notification on my xfinity app for 6 different websites trigging a security warning from his devices. I texted Anna, and sure enough, he’d been at the apartment all day without Gabby. The next day I was heading back to the apartment from being out of state for 2.5 weeks and the same thing. So I texted before she got back from work to see what’s going on and to express my concerns. \n\nAfter this text exchange she came back, and we all talked. Anna started the convo but Gabby started raising her voice and saying “I’m allowed whoever whenever I live here it’s also my lease.” She was also trying to say he was only over 2 days this week, which wasn’t true. The lease does clarify the only other occupants allowed are spouses of the tenant and children. Everyone else is considered a temporary visitor who is not entitled to the same lease rights. \n\nWe came to a “reasonable” conclusion: he can only stay until noon by the latest if he sleeps over on a work night, and Gabby has to chip in more for utilities to cover him. And he is allowed over 3 nights. I just found this whole thing wild; we didn’t sign up for 4 people living here we signed up for 3. We are going to monitor how often he is over now. AIO?",

I went in a got a small box of chicken-minis. Shared one with another coworker and grabbed a biscuit and put it in my pocket. I've brought food more times than I can count, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nThe secretary came to me later and said,\" Someone took two things instead of one. There wasn't enough for everyone\" \n\nI was like, \"Yeah, I did that.\" I didn't know it was a certain number. Whenever I bring in food I bring in enough where there is Always extra.\n\nHer reply was that we were only supposed to take one. At no point did anyone say that to me.\n\nShe was like, \"Yeah I know, I placed one in my pocket. I can run up down and buy more.\" She said not too.\n\nAt that point of time another coworker overheard. They asked what was going on and she immediately told. So of course probably not even an hour later everyone in the office knew. I was super embarrassed.\n\nTo make up for it I brought in an entire sack of biscuits the next morning. I walked away and two of my coworkers started yelling that there was only 3 biscuits. I was like no way, I didn't count, but there should me at least 11 biscuits in the bag. I saw several of them heading to the breakroom so I thought maybe someone had placed them in the fridge. I when I got to the breakroom them pulled and was like, \"Nope they were just in my pocket!\"\n\nI turned around and left. One of the guys that was standing there, but not really involved came over afterwards. Told me he wasn't involved, but he was really sorry for what happened.\n\nThis next part might not really be involved in this story, but I wanted to lay everything out in the open. This next part I might be the one in the wrong.\n\nI'm friends with HR. She doesn't hang out with anyone outside of work, which I just always assume it's because she is HR. We do go to lunch some times and I call her my work sister.\n\nThe next day I hear she is having a get together with a couple of other ladies in the dept. Yes, they are all women with kids, but I was rather annoyed, because in the past she would never hang out with anyone outside of work. It was her idea for this get together and I did not get an invite. I'm a guy and I don't have kids, which is fair, but still annoyed me.\n\nSo I was already not in a good mood and this annoyed me when normally it wouldn't.. She started talking with me and when another coworker that was going to her house came up, she ignored me and started talking with them about the event. After 5 minutes I excused myself to go back to my desk. Later she came by and said, \"I said thank you for the biscuit yesterday, not sure why you have an attitude with me.\"\n\nI just kind mumbled K, I wasn't sure what that had to do with anything and I went back to work. \n\nLater came up and was talking to me about haircuts and how difficult it was to stay this beautiful as a woman and that it took a lot of maintenance. Still not in the mood I just kind rolled my eyes and replied, \"Whatever you want to tell yourself.\" Which caused my HR friend to go into a angry rant about me being grumpy. \n\nOne again HR and one of the coworker involved in the biscuit incident started talking about a coworker that was recently fired and other girl mentioned she was missing that fired coworker. I was just kind of like...\"ok\". I wasn't really that close with the person that got fired, he caused a lot of issues in the business, and the only reason he wasn't fired sooner was because he was friends with the boss. Not sure what he did to get fired, but it had to have been bad. Like stealing money, bad, at least that's my guess. The entire thing was very hush hush. HR friend was like \"You would miss OP if he was gone?\" to the girl that was. The other girl said she would miss me a lot. I just kind replied, \"I really don't care.\" I guess this is where I'm kind of in the wrong, but at this point I just kind of wanted them to leave me alone. It was clear I was in a bad mood and not ready to forgive anyone. \n\nHR yelled at me not to be so grumpy. My reply is \"I will feel how I want to feel, HR.\" About that time our boss walked over and we changed the subject.\n\nAIO? \n\nI just kind of feel done with everyone. I'm usually the happy positive one, so it has been super obvious to everyone I'm not happy with them, and they have been nice to me since then. \n\nI'm the guy you want on your projects with you because I'm really good at figuring things out and getting things done. I get great year end reviews, but after all of this I just want to leave. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but I feel humiliated and disrespected.",

My last boyfriend I dated since highschool, so this is my first \"adult\" relationship. Is it normal for me to not meet his mom? Like, he asks me to leave his house when she's coming over. It doesn't hurt my feelings yet but I don't know if it SHOULD. 3 months isn't a very long time at all but we do spend a lot of time together.... so I'm wondering if he's taking me seriously or not. Can a man in their 30s give me some insight on the typical mindset? I am pretty close with my family and hangout regularly so maybe I'm just too casual about him meeting mine? Help!\n\nTL;DR : my bf won't let me meet his mom and idk if that's weird!",

My husband works at a mine, 2 weeks away and 2 weeks at home. When he first started there, he talked about how this woman, Brittany, was a bitch to him. \n\nHe was boarding the plane to the mine, and looked at the seat next to her and she said to him “you’re not sitting with me”. He has also told me that she has a reputation for sleeping around the camp.\n\nHe then comes home a few weeks ago, and said he’s up for a promotion for good performance at work. Coincidentally, the day this came out, Brittany wants to sit with him at meal time and make friendly with him. He goes on to say “she isn’t that bad”.\n\nI told him that all of that is fucking weird. It’s weird that he went from saying she’s a bitch to being friendly, and it’s weird that she’s suddenly nice to him since he’s getting promoted. He thinks I’m crazy for thinking that and that nobody else would find this weird. So, am I overreacting?",

    "text": "AIO for not getting a birthday gift of my choice? so hear me out everyone… \n\nI’m in a relationship with this person who is doing financially ok (and makes more than me). This will come in to play later in story. \n\nWe’ve been together for a while and normally we do typical things when it comes to birthday such as gifts and cake. normally the gifts have been nice (from my perspective). It could be things like nice lotions or maybe a new kitchen appliance. A lot of my gift request also tend to be things that we could share like a water filter.\n\nIn recent years, we normally have an Amazon wish list where we can just pick things. But this year was a little bit difficult. my birthday comes first in the calendar, and I remember having a variety of items on my list, including socks and underwear. The most expensive thing was probably the mini AI pet.\n\nI got a comment from my partner, which was that putting socks and underwear on my wish list wasn’t cool because those aren’t considered real gifts. Even though I would appreciate them. \n\nfast-forward, on the day of my birthday, my partner tells me that I will get a gift late this year, which is fine with me. Eventually, I was presented with a storage cart. It’s one of those things you build yourself and you can put stuff on it and you can wheel it around. Apparently that was my gift. And yes, I definitely was spoiled at this point even though I actually did like the item. And then the second item was a bedframe for my mattress (which I really didn’t need). I was a little bit letdown. And maybe I am really unappreciative \n\nI got a lecture afterwards saying that I should just appreciate what I got. Part of me feels a little hurt because I know this person will spend more money on their own family’s bday than mine. But also, this person has been lecturing me a lot more about how I live my life. \n\nA month later comes my partner’s birthday. I know this person did not update their wishlist, so I asked them what they wanted. I was told macbook, ipad, smart ring, remarkable pro… stuff that can go 1.2k and up…. \n\nAnd when I made a comment about how these are all luxury items… the response I got was “ Don’t worry about it then, I’ll get it myself someday.”\n\n that response hurt me deep. And I can’t forget it… this person makes a significant amount more than me, and they’ve been known to throw money away on things that don’t always make sense… whereas I’m the kind of person that has to count every dollar to make sure I can pay all the bills.. \n\nAt this point, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting … am I reading too much into the statement? what should i do? i can probably afford something from the list, but part of me feels sad that my partner didn’t want to treat me to something off my list… birthdays come once a year and i honestly feel i won’t have many more due to my health (separate story on that). :(",

    "text": "AIO to my kids Christmas outfit not being prepped for her by the stay at home parent? My husband is a stay at home dad. I run a medium not for profit, it’s a busy job with lots of travel. We have 2 kids (4 and 7) and he gave up working after our eldest started school as his job couldn’t accommodate an early finish to match school hours (he worked a much lower paying job in admin so it made sense but I still recognise the sacrifice made). Both kids are now at school but I still have to be on top of everything and it is exhausting.\n\nThis week I have been leaving at 5am and getting home at around 8:30pm (except one day where I got home at 1am due to some bad traffic). When I get in I do bedtime with the kids and if the 4 year old wakes up in the night (which she usually does at least once) then I get up with her as he doesn’t hear her. (Giving this info for context).\n\nLast night he said he’d put a Christmas gift away he said it like he was currently doing it so I didn’t give it a second thought but for whatever reason he didn’t and this morning our daughter saw it. Frustrating and I expressed disappointment as it was something on her list so spoilt the Christmas magic a bit but who hasn’t gotten distracted on the way to do something. \n\nNext I reminded him it was her Christmas show. He’d already got it wrong earlier in the week despite a text message from me reminding him exactly what was needed. (He gets all the same information as I do from the school but doesn’t seem to log it, mentally or otherwise). He brought down the wrong outfit (it was a Christmas T-shirt and jeans which she wouldn’t have been allowed to wear) and said she didn’t have anything else. I went to look she did have other things but the outfit I knew she wanted to wear wasn’t put away or in the laundry. I told him I noticed he’d washed it yesterday and asked if he remembered what he’d done with it. He didn’t. This seemed to anger him but I eventually found the outfit he’d put it somewhere it wouldn’t usually go.\n\nNext her Christmas jumper was wet in the laundry and I couldn’t get it dry in the next 20 mins so that had to be skipped. \n\nFinally her Christmas antlers she’d chosen had been tidied away and he couldn’t remember what he’d done with them.\n\nBy this time I was just feed up. He was angrily following me around telling me I couldn’t do anything for myself (because I was asking where the things he’d put away literally yesterday were). Please bear in mind I found ever item myself, he maintained he couldn’t remember what he’d done with any of them but seemed to hate that I was asking him about it. \n\nBy this time I was late setting off, they were late for school and I was beyond fed up. Needless to say we ended up arguing with me asking why this wasn’t all sorted and why I was having to remind him of the laundry loads he’s done. I already do all the mental load but having to be his working memory as well was too much. Him saying it was just a dress and didn’t matter (it doesn’t to him, they frequently don’t have the things they need for school despite me sending morning reminders when I’m travelling). He continued that I was overreacting and that the only crime he’d committed was washing her clothes for her. \n\nTL/DR - husband stays home with the kids but isn’t on top of the school schedule, often leaving the kids without what they need and acts like I am high maintenance for expecting them to have what they need. \n\nAIO?",

    "text": "AIO think I'm married to a narcissist. Married for 4 years together almost 10. Have one biological hyperactive adhd boy (5) who I swear is on the spectrum (being tested for) and my son he chose to accept back at the age of 2 1/2. Now 12 . He has shown many, many signs of being a selfish narc. But didn't show them till our child we had together was about 2yo. He claimed his job stressed him out. So we moved across the US for a new job. That's when things FELL apart. \n\nHis anger he claims he over came, came out like a thousand hot daggers. The way he treats not only me, but our youngest and eldest is just. Toxic. He gets angry red hot over the smallest things. He's never \"hit\" anyone. But threatens spanking  the kids and will yank the youngest by his arm for timeouts, over the littlest thing. Which is yelling in his face at top notch with his loud booming voice and if im being real. I think there have been times he has slapped him on his bottom due to anger. Under circumstances, our fights have led to him belittling me, calling me names little B****. I told him are not acceptable as I never call him a jerk AH our D bag. Even when acting like one. He degrades the kids calling them dumb, stupid and spoiled. When they aren't. \n\n He thinks working all day at a salary job with a degree he chose, is so much that 5 minutes at home, while me being tapped out from handling everything else, is TOO MUCH.  He gets to play video games, leave to hang out with friends or a work function a drop of the dime. I never get out or even have friends. Because I'm a SAHM until our youngest is capable of going to school with occupational therapy to help him succeed. Even then I don't see me getting me time, ever in the future. He complains at my vices, when he was ready to quit the Same things, because he is ready. But I couldn't handle quitting them, if he did, because he was miserable to deal with and the kids. \n\nI'm the family mediator, care taker, makes all appointments unless it's his car or his health. He just doesn't seem to have wanted a family just the idea of it. And honestly wishing he just left me alone as a single mom back then doing my thing and succeeding. Now I'm states away from support and wondering what do I do. Thought I could suck it up and he would grow up. But he has only gotten worse. Many times I've thought about starting the back up plan to be supporting me and these boys so he can finally have his dream. A lazy bachelor doing whatever he wants but he always snaps to bread crumbs of small apologies and change, that he really didn't mean it. Am I over reacting or am I in a traumatic response? I'm asking because I don't have a ton of family who is mentally aware or would ever tell me what they think. I need a third out side party to see if this is red flag or am I just an iverwhekmed exhausted mom. \n\nSorry for typos/ grammer and ranting. I'm typing from phone and new to reddit. And I'm also at my millionth time of giving up and exhaustion. It's hitting the hardest as holidays are around the corner and this is a holiday meant to be about family and being thankful to have it. But things without detail are really crashing around from kiddos health to mine plus house issues in winter are piling up. \n\nPlease any opinions on my spewing out the littlest details would help. But if not I guess it feels good to get off my chest somewhere. \n\nEdit to add I'm very happy being a mom to these boys I chose to have. Even though it does get very overwhelming and stressful. I would never say I regret it or poor me. Just wish maybe the partner I thought I married turned out to be the man every devoted mother and wife end up with. I guess I'm seeing the mask slip, and I wonder, am I overreacting from past trauma, or does everyone else maybe outside of the world see little red flags, too?",

    "text": "AIO MY(24M) GF(24F) KINDA CHEATED ON ME MONTHS AGO BUT NOT REALLY ? Hi, im a 24 year old male and in a relationship with my gf. We had some problem which i used a translate app to explain here so that there are no misunderstandings and i can get all the help and advices from you people. I dont think its forbidden in this community but if it is know that it is definitely real, my words, just translated from another language.\n\n  \nWe broke up three months ago, and it was a pretty messy breakup. About a month before we split, she had started talking to another guy. He messaged her on Instagram, and when I saw it, I warned her. I told her he clearly wasn’t trying to be “just friends,” but she didn’t believe me and even got upset with me. Later on, I messaged the guy myself and told him to back off.\n\nThen for about two weeks, while she was still with me, she kept meeting up with him. There wasn’t anything physical or emotional going on (according to her), but they did go out together. She even travelled to his hometown to meet him, drove around with him in his car, talked for hours, etc.\n\nOne night, while we were still together, she told me she was going to visit a female friend. Then she turned off her phone and stayed unreachable until around 11 PM. Later she admitted she had been sitting in a park with that guy the whole time. She told me all of this herself. She said she regretted it and that she only did it because our relationship had been going really badly at the time. She promised she would never do anything like that again as long as we were doing well.\n\nBut honestly… it still feels like a huge betrayal. And the worst part is that whatever was happening between them only ended because *he* stopped showing interest. If he hadn’t backed off, she probably would’ve ended up with him, and we would’ve never gotten back together. (We were broken up for 2 months and then reconciled.)\n\nThat night when she turned off her phone, I completely broke down. I had a panic attack, my friends had to help calm me down for hours. When she finally turned her phone back on and I confronted her yelled at her, she acted like I had no right to be upset. Even months later, when the topic came up, she tried to make me feel guilty about it—saying things like, “You hurt me so much by yelling at me. I felt horrible,” without acknowledging what she had been doing.I didnt know about the other guy at the time.\n\nOnce she even told me that there are no secrets between us and i know everything about her and what she's been doing since the breakup. There obviously were some secrets though.\n\nWhen she finally admitted everything and I connected all the pieces, it crushed me. Something in me just… broke. I developed this constant feeling of distrust. She’s been trying really hard to fix things and rebuild what she damaged, but I still feel awful throughout the day. If I don’t hear from her for even a minute, my mind immediately jumps to “Is she with someone else?” or “Is she pulling away from me?”\n\nRight now she’s abroad and can only reach me when she finds Wi-Fi—so every 2–3 hours. She tries to update me and reassure me, but I’m constantly stressed and anxious. It’s exhausting. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if what happened is actually serious.\n\nSo now im always anxious and always questioning her, where is he, what is she doing etc. She's trying to help but sometimes snaps at me.\n\n\n\nFor context, we’ve been together for 3 years: 1.5 years in the same city, 1.5 years long-distance but meeting every month. We’re even planning to get married next year and had already started preparing for it. But this whole situation resurfaced and completely shattered my trust. The fact that she hid all of this from me for so long makes it so hard to believe her now.",

It’s just me and one primary rep covering our territory.\n\nRecently, it’s been treated as a given that I will cover every single weekend case if we have one (they are unpredictable and only happen in emergent cases / when our docs are on call). I brought up that I think we should split weekends instead of it always falling on me.\n\nHe’s technically my superior, but we’re both adults with full lives outside of work. Being an associate doesn’t mean my time is less valuable or that I’m an unlimited resource. He then told me that if I were a full rep as well, he would split weekends with me — but since I’m an associate, it “makes sense” that I take them.\n\nI honestly think that’s unfair. I’m still providing the same level of support in cases, the same availability, and the same workload during the week. The territory doesn’t function without both of us, and I don’t think hierarchy = automatic weekend dumping.\n\nI told him that expecting me to cover every weekend feels outdated and that I’m not willing to be taken advantage of. I’m not asking to opt out of weekends entirely — just for a reasonable, sustainable split.\n\nSo… AIO for pushing back and saying weekend coverage should be shared instead of me being the default person every time?",

    "text": "AIO to my friends' dads' comments (Written in September, posted in December)\nFor context, I (17f) am friends with a classmate (17f) and have been for going on 5 years. I've always been very close with her family, closer than with my own, and throughout that, anything I've disagreed with hasn't been enough to cause an actual drift in our relationship. Her father and I usually have somewhat different opinions on things, and maybe disagree on something small once a month, but it's not usually this big of a deal to me. The only other time when I have felt this hurt over something was an accumulation of multiple things that finally burst over last winter, and I can't even remember what they were.\n\nThe one that is still causing physical pain whenever I think about it happened about 1 1/2 months ago.\n\nOn the car ride to the lake, we'd (Me, my brother's friend, my friend's cousin, my friend's aunt, and my friend's mom) gotten into a conversation about how dolphins are actually terrible, mainly because male dolphins will surround a female dolphin and 'take turns', sometimes for multiple days at a time. Another thing that was brought up was how dolphins will play with puffer fish to get high off their toxins. I claimed that, really, only the male dolphins are terrible, because humans exploit other living things to get high all the time, so dolphins can't be in the wrong more than humans who cause harm consciously and still choose to continue.\n\nThis was brought up a few hours later while we (me, friends' dad, friends' uncle, their friend, and a couple of other girls that I can't exactly remember) were in the water, when about half of the family was there. I had thought about the conversation earlier, and I brought it up. I began talking about the whole dolphin thing, and I remember being interrupted the first time with him saying something about dolphins really just being terrible. He interrupts often, so I just continued finishing my thought about the whole pufferfish thing. He then said, I fuck you not, that I was \"jealous because I wanted a dolphin to rape me.\"\n\nWhat.\n\nThe.\n\nFuck.\n\nNow I have thought about this nearly every day since, trying to come up with any possible way I heard him wrong. I really wish I had just heard him wrong. But I didn't. \n\nI just stared at him. Like, how do you respond to that? I think I said something like \"are you serious\" or \"for real?\", trying to make it clear that this is when you apologize and take it back. He didn't. I tried to make it a bit by slowly backing out of the water, in a \"I'm leaving if you don't apologize' way, but in hindsight, not very funny, just really accurately expressed how uncomfortable I was. He said, \"I'm sorry it made you uncomfortable, but it was a joke. I'm not going to apologize because you don't find it funny.\"\n\nI felt like everyone was looking at me, and I finally gave in to the pressure and just started acting like everything was fine, and found a casual excuse to get out of the water without drawing attention or making people think something was wrong. \n\nI was just flabbergasted. Like really, that is the only accurate word or it. I went up to our stuff and sat down, and started talking to some of the friends that were there. I felt like I was going crazy, so I brought it up. The other girl there agreed it was a crazy thing to say, but we moved on.\n\nI would put more context about my relationship with my friend's family, but I really don't think I need to. In my mind, no amount of context could justify saying something like that and refusing to apologize for it. The family is self-labeled as emotionally healthy and mature, so I know they'll say I should talk to him about it, but with his memory issues and sometimes controversial sense of right and wrong, I can't imagine a scenario where this ends with an actual apology.",

But I spent $1000 on these Xmas cards (overkill I know but it was my first time sending them and I wanted them to be amazing!). The PDF is the proof I approved. I selected a dark red/wine color to make the photo pop and feel really festive. What I received instead was thanksgiving orange. The designer is claiming “reds are hard” and this is within the allowances for shade discrepancies but come on….at this price?? I would have been fine with a shade discrepancy if it had at least been like a bright cherry or apple red but this is pumpkin orange. AIO for expecting a partial credit/refund? They can’t reprint them since the photos are hand applied and it’s too close to Christmas.",

But she has a friend that I am concerned about and I'm not sure if i'm looking too far into it or if I have any basis to be worried. So she has a friend that she works with and I've been noticing some stuff that to me seems odd. Her friend who is also a female is always trying to be around her and has \"pretended\" to fall and grabbed her boob in the process. The friend has also given her gifts and stuff before and said she would buy her stuff if she had sex with her. Now my girlfriend has says she's not into her but they're always going out to the store together, or getting food, or going to the bank, etc. Meanwhile she never does that with me. The biggest thing I'm concerned about right now is that her friend is gonna be moving in with her now and I definitely have thoughts in the back of my head about what is gonna happen.",

    "text": "AIO? my dad (52M) forgot about my (17NB) play so the title is pretty self-explanatory. but here’s some context! this is my second year in theatre, my dad has done children’s theatre in the past and has told numerous stories about it. this is my first rep show for my school, and i’m in a production of pliant girls! i play kay (for everyone who knows who this is. if not, highly recommend you check it out!) and i love her. however, i auditioned for the other rep show (ride the cyclone) and was bitter about not getting in at first, so i kept pliant girls on the DL. HOWEVER, i told my dad about this production and he was the one that signed the audition form letting me… well… audition for the show.\n\nflash forward to thanksgiving, i bring up at the table that im playing a lead in pliant girls. my parents look really confused at each other and then back at me, and my dad says AND I QUOTE: ”…wait… you’re in another show?” i was a bit heartbroken and i look at my mom and she shrugs as well. my dad has in the past shrugged off my theatre accomplishments (i.e. after a really bad callback and when i was on the verge of tears he said “well at least you’ll get something.”) and so this hurt. tonight as well, i asked him if any of my extended family was seeing the show, to which he AGAIN looked bewildered and asked “whats pliant girls?..” to which i had to explain everything.\n\nthe reason im asking this is bc i KNOW it’s partly my fault they forgot, i kept it on the DL and my rehearsals are during school. however, this still hurts especially since my dad claims he is very involved in all aspects of my life (mostly work bc i don’t have a license and theatre.) am i overreacting? is this truly not a big deal?\n\nedit: thank you all so much for the comments, advice, and feedback, it means a lot to me. to clear some things up\n\n1: my dad does not have problems with his memory yet.\n\n2: i do already have a therapist and i will be talking with her about this too, ty for the suggestions\n\n3: no the play is not over and no i didn’t intentionally hide it from him, like him it slipped my mind because of the show i was already in.\n\n4: i will be putting all my stuff on the calendar, ty for the suggestion :)\n\n5: me and my dad both have horrendous social cue skills (we’re both autistic) so naturally miscommunications like this happen. i’m not saying this as an “i have autism card” im just pointing this out bc i left out crucial context.\n\n6: i probably will take this post down, so thank you for all the comments and not being rude to me, i’m just scared of people being genuinely rude or mean about the whole situation (and also the notifications) thank you so much again for all the advice i will keep this in mind :) as always, stay safe spread love and rock on 💜",

    "text": "AIO for thinking my mom is infantilizing me? I just got off the phone with my mom feeling very frustrated and I wasn’t sure why. For context, I am a 23 year old woman living in my own place, financially independent, with a fiancée. The only thing that she can technically “hold” over me is that she put a down payment on my new car as a gift. \nSo I call my mom telling her about a concert I’m going to(my first concert too!). She asks me who I’m going with and I tell her a friend that she’s heard a bit about. Then she says, “I hope you didn’t pay for her ticket.” This was my mistake but when her tone gets like that, my people pleasing defense mechanism(that was built Because of hearing that tone all my life and getting punished for it) activated, and I said I didn’t to keep the peace. I didn’t want her to kick up a fuss about a $20 ticket that I bought with my own money. My mistake. Anyway, she continues to say that she doesn’t think I should be friends with someone “dumb and irresponsible” like my friend and that she doesn’t like me hanging out with her. My friend is also an adult and her crime in my mom’s eyes is having unprotected sex with her fiancé before marriage. She goes back to trying to convince me not to go. I understand that to some degree, since the concert will be held at night and there’s a possibility that I might end up going alone, but I want to go! I’ve been really excited for it and I thought this would be a great reward after killing it on my final exams at school. A light phone call about me telling her about a concert I was excited to go to turned into her basically berating me. Am I overreacting for thinking that my mom is still treating me like a child?",

    "text": "AIO Friend claims she’s responsible for my relationship Me and my boyfriend met in February at University and started hanging out nearly 4-5 times a week until May. At the time it was nothing serious and we both told eachother we didn’t want a relationship, as we both knew the semester was ending soon and that we would both have to go back to our home states which are across the country. \n\nOnce the semester ended, we stayed in touch all throughout the summer. We were both  hooking up with other people, but we would still call and text a lot to catch up. As soon as the new semester started, the absolute first night he moved in he asked me to sleepover because he wanted to see me so bad. I slept over and all was well and we continued to hang out daily since we were both back and happy to be with each other. We were still not exclusive and just in a talking stage for a while, and eventually I introduced him to some of my good friends that i had met in August. \n\nWe all got along super well at first and would hang out nightly in our dorms. My friends noticed how close me and this guy were and how we would act like a couple and they fully supported it and wanted us to actually be officially together. They would do some silly things like ask him how he felt about me or if he wanted to be with me, and it got us pretty much nowhere because he would just say he liked me but wasn’t ready for a relationship (which i already knew). We all continued hanging out in a group and eventually took a trip together. Over this trip, things developed and me and him started getting a lot closer. He started sleeping over every night, and we eventually started dating and fell in love rather quickly. \n\nNow, back to my friends. They’ve been kind of weird this whole relationship. We’re young so this next part may sound juvenile but somethings i noticed was one of my friends added him on snapchat and asked him to add her back (he reluctantly did because we were all friends). She asked me if her snapping him would make me uncomfortable and I told her honestly that it would bug me a bit if they consistently snap chatted every day, so she promised she wouldn’t and said she understood. Flash forward a few weeks later, she has a streak with him and is sending him videos of her and her friend rubbing their feet together in foot masks? It was so bizarre they didn’t send that video to me, just him, and brought it up infront of me. He agrees this was weird and stopped snapping them because that was just icky. Something else to keep in mind is that when we all hung out, I used to sit next to him on one of our beds, but then before we started dating we were not allowed to sit together because my friends freak out and get uncomfortable and kind of throw digs at us.  \n\nThis friend is now claiming that she’s the reason we’re happily together and says it’s “genuinely because of her that we’re together and dating” but in my view, while she may have helped us get together through just agreeing to group hangouts or maybe doing some setups (i can’t even think of any right now), but barely considering we weren’t even allowed to sit next to eachother (still aren’t even though we’re dating). Another thing is, we’ve been talking since february, before we even MET that girl, so how is it fully her doing. It just really rubs me the wrong way and I want to call her out but is that rude? Am I overreacting about this?",

At first I didnt care, but she does it pretty often now. Sometimes Im half asleep or in the middle of something and it just throws me off when she knocks out of nowhere.\n\nThe last time she came over I had been napping and I guess I sounded annoyed when I told her she should really let me know before coming. She didnt say much but she left kind of quickly. Later I heard from my mom that she’s upset and thinks I dont want her around.\n\nNow Im sitting here feeling guilty because I didnt mean it that way at all. I just like having a heads up before someone shows up. But now Im wondering if I made it bigger than it needed to be. Maybe I was tired and handled it badly. Maybe she took it more personally because of the way I said it. I cant tell anymore.\n\nSo yeah am I overthinking this whole situation or is it actually normal to want some privacy in your own home",

    "text": "AIO-My cousin (40sM) wants to visit me abroad and meet my friends (35F), but he has a long history of using and hurting women — including my own friends. My family says I’m “immature” for refusing. Am I wrong? I (35F) moved to Thailand recently, and my cousin (40sM) now wants to visit me, have me show him around, and meet my friends. Given his history, I told him no — and now my family is calling me immature and saying I should “grow up.” I need some outside perspective.\n\nMy cousin has a long, well-known pattern of treating women terribly. For decades, he’s done the same cycle:\n\n* pursue a woman intensely\n* pretend he’s in love\n* sleep with her for a few months\n* disappear\n* deny paternity if she gets pregnant until forced by court\n* get arrested for domestic violence\n* claim he loves her again\n* get her to bail him out\n* then leave for the next woman\n\nThis behavior started in his teens/20s and has continued into his 40s with no change.\n\nThe part that affects me personally: he specifically targets *my* friends. He has told me outright that he does it “because it’s fun.” He doesn’t do this with other cousins’ friends — only mine.\n\nHe has slept with several of my friends from back home, including:\n\n* my high school friend, who had a baby with him and was dumped a few months postpartum; he denied the child until court-ordered\n* another friend (also my bishop’s granddaughter), whom he publicly humiliated by bragging to the entire town\n\nHe would make comments in front of me like, “Better watch out, I might get another one,” or ask if my friends were single. Every time, I warned my friends about him and emphasized I didn’t want to be involved. Some ignored me, dated him secretly, and later came crying when everything blew up. I ended several friendships because of this pattern.\n\nMy family has always brushed it off. They say I shouldn’t “police” his love life, or that I’m overreacting. At one point they even accused me of being jealous. (For the record: absolutely not. Even if we weren’t related, I wouldn’t go near someone who treats women like that.)\n\nNow that I live abroad, he wants to come to Thailand and “meet my friends.” I told him no — I don’t want a repeat of losing friendships, dealing with drama, or watching him hurt more women.\n\nHe ran to the family about it, and now they’re telling me I’m immature, that his behavior is in the past, and that I need to “grow up” and host him. But the last time I was back home (just a year ago), he was still in and out of jail for domestic violence. Nothing has changed.\n\nI feel like I’m being pressured to put my own life and relationships at risk for someone who has never taken responsibility for anything. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to protect my friends — and myself — from someone with a proven decades-long pattern.\n\n**Would I be wrong for refusing to let him visit or meet my friends?**\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nMy cousin has a decades-long pattern of manipulating women, refusing to take responsibility for his children, and getting arrested for domestic violence — including hurting several of my past friends. He specifically targets *my* friends “because it’s fun.” Now he wants to visit me in Thailand and meet my new friends, and my family says I’m “immature” for saying no. I don’t want more drama or destroyed friendships. Am I wrong to refuse?",

    "text": "AIO my roommate has her fiancé practically living with us This has been something my roommate (Anna, 24F ) and I (23F) have been wanting to talk about with Gabby (24F). She started seeing this guy a few months back, and they’re pretty serious. We all moved in together a couple of months ago, but slowly her now fiancé “Mark” has been over more and more. They got engaged over a month ago. He’ll stay a bit in the morning when Gabby leaves for work and then come back in the evening when she comes back.\n\nHe tends to be over 4-5 days a week, and some of those days he sleeps over. We pay for gas and electric, so Anna and I had a plan to go over utilities and how they’re split. I got a notification on my xfinity app for 6 different websites trigging a security warning from his devices. I texted Anna, and sure enough, he’d been at the apartment all day without Gabby. The next day I was heading back to the apartment from being out of state for 2.5 weeks and the same thing. So I texted before she got back from work to see what’s going on and to express my concerns. \n\nAfter this text exchange she came back, and we all talked. Anna started the convo but Gabby started raising her voice and saying “I’m allowed whoever whenever I live here it’s also my lease.” She was also trying to say he was only over 2 days this week, which wasn’t true. The lease does clarify the only other occupants allowed are spouses of the tenant and children. Everyone else is considered a temporary visitor who is not entitled to the same lease rights. \n\nWe came to a “reasonable” conclusion: he can only stay until noon by the latest if he sleeps over on a work night, and Gabby has to chip in more for utilities to cover him. And he is allowed over 3 nights. I just found this whole thing wild; we didn’t sign up for 4 people living here we signed up for 3. We are going to monitor how often he is over now. AIO?",

My husband works at a mine, 2 weeks away and 2 weeks at home. When he first started there, he talked about how this woman, Brittany, was a bitch to him. \n\nHe was boarding the plane to the mine, and looked at the seat next to her and she said to him “you’re not sitting with me”. He has also told me that she has a reputation for sleeping around the camp.\n\nHe then comes home a few weeks ago, and said he’s up for a promotion for good performance at work. Coincidentally, the day this came out, Brittany wants to sit with him at meal time and make friendly with him. He goes on to say “she isn’t that bad”.\n\nI told him that all of that is fucking weird. It’s weird that he went from saying she’s a bitch to being friendly, and it’s weird that she’s suddenly nice to him since he’s getting promoted. He thinks I’m crazy for thinking that and that nobody else would find this weird. So, am I overreacting?",

No warning, no conversation just went through it on her own. She found old texts with my ex from about six months ago from before we were exclusive and now she’s demanding explanations like I did something wrong.\n\nThe thing is I’m not even that defensive about the texts themselves. They were from a time when I was single and nothing in them crossed a line. What’s bothering me way more is the fact that she went through my phone while I was unconscious. That feels like a serious violation of privacy.\n\nNow the whole situation feels flipped. Instead of talking about why she felt it was okay to secretly go through my phone I’m being interrogated over something that happened before our relationship was defined.\n\nI was sitting on my balcony earlier trying to figure out if I’m being too sensitive but I can’t shake how uncomfortable this feels. The trust feels damaged and I’m not even the one who crossed the boundary first.\n\nAm I overreacting for being upset about this or is this actually a big deal?",

At first I didnt care, but she does it pretty often now. Sometimes Im half asleep or in the middle of something and it just throws me off when she knocks out of nowhere.\n\nThe last time she came over I had been napping and I guess I sounded annoyed when I told her she should really let me know before coming. She didnt say much but she left kind of quickly. Later I heard from my mom that she’s upset and thinks I dont want her around.\n\nNow Im sitting here feeling guilty because I didnt mean it that way at all. I just like having a heads up before someone shows up. But now Im wondering if I made it bigger than it needed to be. Maybe I was tired and handled it badly. Maybe she took it more personally because of the way I said it. I cant tell anymore.\n\nSo yeah am I overthinking this whole situation or is it actually normal to want some privacy in your own home",

It’s also the only time we are all available until January, because we’re in university together and in that weird gap between finals and the holidays.\n\nAbout an hour ago, one of the people said that he has a sore throat and can’t make it.

She said that I was being rude for wanting to exclude the other guy. The problem is, I haven’t seen them in about a month (still daily texting, just no in person hangouts even though each of us live literally 5 min away by walking) because he keeps cancelling. \n\nI asked if she would be willing if I asked if it was alright, and she just repeated that it would be rude to exclude him, but to ask anyways. I then texted him and asked if he would mind, and he said “of course not” and to bring him some cookies (we were planning on making them together!). She hasn’t responded to that yet, and we’re currently 30 min away from the time we were planning to meet up. \n\nIs it actually rude to keep the plans if someone cancels??

    "text": "AIO to my kids Christmas outfit not being prepped for her by the stay at home parent? My husband is a stay at home dad. I run a medium not for profit, it’s a busy job with lots of travel. We have 2 kids (4 and 7) and he gave up working after our eldest started school as his job couldn’t accommodate an early finish to match school hours (he worked a much lower paying job in admin so it made sense but I still recognise the sacrifice made). Both kids are now at school but I still have to be on top of everything and it is exhausting.\n\nThis week I have been leaving at 5am and getting home at around 8:30pm (except one day where I got home at 1am due to some bad traffic). When I get in I do bedtime with the kids and if the 4 year old wakes up in the night (which she usually does at least once) then I get up with her as he doesn’t hear her. (Giving this info for context).\n\nLast night he said he’d put a Christmas gift away he said it like he was currently doing it so I didn’t give it a second thought but for whatever reason he didn’t and this morning our daughter saw it. Frustrating and I expressed disappointment as it was something on her list so spoilt the Christmas magic a bit but who hasn’t gotten distracted on the way to do something. \n\nNext I reminded him it was her Christmas show. He’d already got it wrong earlier in the week despite a text message from me reminding him exactly what was needed. (He gets all the same information as I do from the school but doesn’t seem to log it, mentally or otherwise). He brought down the wrong outfit (it was a Christmas T-shirt and jeans which she wouldn’t have been allowed to wear) and said she didn’t have anything else. I went to look she did have other things but the outfit I knew she wanted to wear wasn’t put away or in the laundry. I told him I noticed he’d washed it yesterday and asked if he remembered what he’d done with it. He didn’t. This seemed to anger him but I eventually found the outfit he’d put it somewhere it wouldn’t usually go.\n\nNext her Christmas jumper was wet in the laundry and I couldn’t get it dry in the next 20 mins so that had to be skipped. \n\nFinally her Christmas antlers she’d chosen had been tidied away and he couldn’t remember what he’d done with them.\n\nBy this time I was just feed up. He was angrily following me around telling me I couldn’t do anything for myself (because I was asking where the things he’d put away literally yesterday were). Please bear in mind I found ever item myself, he maintained he couldn’t remember what he’d done with any of them but seemed to hate that I was asking him about it. \n\nBy this time I was late setting off, they were late for school and I was beyond fed up. Needless to say we ended up arguing with me asking why this wasn’t all sorted and why I was having to remind him of the laundry loads he’s done. I already do all the mental load but having to be his working memory as well was too much. Him saying it was just a dress and didn’t matter (it doesn’t to him, they frequently don’t have the things they need for school despite me sending morning reminders when I’m travelling). He continued that I was overreacting and that the only crime he’d committed was washing her clothes for her. \n\nTL/DR - husband stays home with the kids but isn’t on top of the school schedule, often leaving the kids without what they need and acts like I am high maintenance for expecting them to have what they need. \n\nAIO?",

    "text": "AIO MY(24M) GF(24F) KINDA CHEATED ON ME MONTHS AGO BUT NOT REALLY ? Hi, im a 24 year old male and in a relationship with my gf. We had some problem which i used a translate app to explain here so that there are no misunderstandings and i can get all the help and advices from you people. I dont think its forbidden in this community but if it is know that it is definitely real, my words, just translated from another language.\n\n  \nWe broke up three months ago, and it was a pretty messy breakup. About a month before we split, she had started talking to another guy. He messaged her on Instagram, and when I saw it, I warned her. I told her he clearly wasn’t trying to be “just friends,” but she didn’t believe me and even got upset with me. Later on, I messaged the guy myself and told him to back off.\n\nThen for about two weeks, while she was still with me, she kept meeting up with him. There wasn’t anything physical or emotional going on (according to her), but they did go out together. She even travelled to his hometown to meet him, drove around with him in his car, talked for hours, etc.\n\nOne night, while we were still together, she told me she was going to visit a female friend. Then she turned off her phone and stayed unreachable until around 11 PM. Later she admitted she had been sitting in a park with that guy the whole time. She told me all of this herself. She said she regretted it and that she only did it because our relationship had been going really badly at the time. She promised she would never do anything like that again as long as we were doing well.\n\nBut honestly… it still feels like a huge betrayal. And the worst part is that whatever was happening between them only ended because *he* stopped showing interest. If he hadn’t backed off, she probably would’ve ended up with him, and we would’ve never gotten back together. (We were broken up for 2 months and then reconciled.)\n\nThat night when she turned off her phone, I completely broke down. I had a panic attack, my friends had to help calm me down for hours. When she finally turned her phone back on and I confronted her yelled at her, she acted like I had no right to be upset. Even months later, when the topic came up, she tried to make me feel guilty about it—saying things like, “You hurt me so much by yelling at me. I felt horrible,” without acknowledging what she had been doing.I didnt know about the other guy at the time.\n\nOnce she even told me that there are no secrets between us and i know everything about her and what she's been doing since the breakup. There obviously were some secrets though.\n\nWhen she finally admitted everything and I connected all the pieces, it crushed me. Something in me just… broke. I developed this constant feeling of distrust. She’s been trying really hard to fix things and rebuild what she damaged, but I still feel awful throughout the day. If I don’t hear from her for even a minute, my mind immediately jumps to “Is she with someone else?” or “Is she pulling away from me?”\n\nRight now she’s abroad and can only reach me when she finds Wi-Fi—so every 2–3 hours. She tries to update me and reassure me, but I’m constantly stressed and anxious. It’s exhausting. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if what happened is actually serious.\n\nSo now im always anxious and always questioning her, where is he, what is she doing etc. She's trying to help but sometimes snaps at me.\n\n\n\nFor context, we’ve been together for 3 years: 1.5 years in the same city, 1.5 years long-distance but meeting every month. We’re even planning to get married next year and had already started preparing for it. But this whole situation resurfaced and completely shattered my trust. The fact that she hid all of this from me for so long makes it so hard to believe her now.",

It’s just me and one primary rep covering our territory.\n\nRecently, it’s been treated as a given that I will cover every single weekend case if we have one (they are unpredictable and only happen in emergent cases / when our docs are on call). I brought up that I think we should split weekends instead of it always falling on me.\n\nHe’s technically my superior, but we’re both adults with full lives outside of work. Being an associate doesn’t mean my time is less valuable or that I’m an unlimited resource. He then told me that if I were a full rep as well, he would split weekends with me — but since I’m an associate, it “makes sense” that I take them.\n\nI honestly think that’s unfair. I’m still providing the same level of support in cases, the same availability, and the same workload during the week. The territory doesn’t function without both of us, and I don’t think hierarchy = automatic weekend dumping.\n\nI told him that expecting me to cover every weekend feels outdated and that I’m not willing to be taken advantage of. I’m not asking to opt out of weekends entirely — just for a reasonable, sustainable split.\n\nSo… AIO for pushing back and saying weekend coverage should be shared instead of me being the default person every time?",

    "text": "AIO-My cousin (40sM) wants to visit me abroad and meet my friends (35F), but he has a long history of using and hurting women — including my own friends. My family says I’m “immature” for refusing. Am I wrong? I (35F) moved to Thailand recently, and my cousin (40sM) now wants to visit me, have me show him around, and meet my friends. Given his history, I told him no — and now my family is calling me immature and saying I should “grow up.” I need some outside perspective.\n\nMy cousin has a long, well-known pattern of treating women terribly. For decades, he’s done the same cycle:\n\n* pursue a woman intensely\n* pretend he’s in love\n* sleep with her for a few months\n* disappear\n* deny paternity if she gets pregnant until forced by court\n* get arrested for domestic violence\n* claim he loves her again\n* get her to bail him out\n* then leave for the next woman\n\nThis behavior started in his teens/20s and has continued into his 40s with no change.\n\nThe part that affects me personally: he specifically targets *my* friends. He has told me outright that he does it “because it’s fun.” He doesn’t do this with other cousins’ friends — only mine.\n\nHe has slept with several of my friends from back home, including:\n\n* my high school friend, who had a baby with him and was dumped a few months postpartum; he denied the child until court-ordered\n* another friend (also my bishop’s granddaughter), whom he publicly humiliated by bragging to the entire town\n\nHe would make comments in front of me like, “Better watch out, I might get another one,” or ask if my friends were single. Every time, I warned my friends about him and emphasized I didn’t want to be involved. Some ignored me, dated him secretly, and later came crying when everything blew up. I ended several friendships because of this pattern.\n\nMy family has always brushed it off. They say I shouldn’t “police” his love life, or that I’m overreacting. At one point they even accused me of being jealous. (For the record: absolutely not. Even if we weren’t related, I wouldn’t go near someone who treats women like that.)\n\nNow that I live abroad, he wants to come to Thailand and “meet my friends.” I told him no — I don’t want a repeat of losing friendships, dealing with drama, or watching him hurt more women.\n\nHe ran to the family about it, and now they’re telling me I’m immature, that his behavior is in the past, and that I need to “grow up” and host him. But the last time I was back home (just a year ago), he was still in and out of jail for domestic violence. Nothing has changed.\n\nI feel like I’m being pressured to put my own life and relationships at risk for someone who has never taken responsibility for anything. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to protect my friends — and myself — from someone with a proven decades-long pattern.\n\n**Would I be wrong for refusing to let him visit or meet my friends?**\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nMy cousin has a decades-long pattern of manipulating women, refusing to take responsibility for his children, and getting arrested for domestic violence — including hurting several of my past friends. He specifically targets *my* friends “because it’s fun.” Now he wants to visit me in Thailand and meet my new friends, and my family says I’m “immature” for saying no.

    "text": "AIO Friend claims she’s responsible for my relationship Me and my boyfriend met in February at University and started hanging out nearly 4-5 times a week until May. At the time it was nothing serious and we both told eachother we didn’t want a relationship, as we both knew the semester was ending soon and that we would both have to go back to our home states which are across the country. \n\nOnce the semester ended, we stayed in touch all throughout the summer. We were both  hooking up with other people, but we would still call and text a lot to catch up. As soon as the new semester started, the absolute first night he moved in he asked me to sleepover because he wanted to see me so bad. I slept over and all was well and we continued to hang out daily since we were both back and happy to be with each other. We were still not exclusive and just in a talking stage for a while, and eventually I introduced him to some of my good friends that i had met in August. \n\nWe all got along super well at first and would hang out nightly in our dorms. My friends noticed how close me and this guy were and how we would act like a couple and they fully supported it and wanted us to actually be officially together. They would do some silly things like ask him how he felt about me or if he wanted to be with me, and it got us pretty much nowhere because he would just say he liked me but wasn’t ready for a relationship (which i already knew). We all continued hanging out in a group and eventually took a trip together. Over this trip, things developed and me and him started getting a lot closer. He started sleeping over every night, and we eventually started dating and fell in love rather quickly. \n\nNow, back to my friends. They’ve been kind of weird this whole relationship. We’re young so this next part may sound juvenile but somethings i noticed was one of my friends added him on snapchat and asked him to add her back (he reluctantly did because we were all friends). She asked me if her snapping him would make me uncomfortable and I told her honestly that it would bug me a bit if they consistently snap chatted every day, so she promised she wouldn’t and said she understood. Flash forward a few weeks later, she has a streak with him and is sending him videos of her and her friend rubbing their feet together in foot masks? It was so bizarre they didn’t send that video to me, just him, and brought it up infront of me. He agrees this was weird and stopped snapping them because that was just icky. Something else to keep in mind is that when we all hung out, I used to sit next to him on one of our beds, but then before we started dating we were not allowed to sit together because my friends freak out and get uncomfortable and kind of throw digs at us.  \n\nThis friend is now claiming that she’s the reason we’re happily together and says it’s “genuinely because of her that we’re together and dating” but in my view, while she may have helped us get together through just agreeing to group hangouts or maybe doing some setups (i can’t even think of any right now), but barely considering we weren’t even allowed to sit next to eachother (still aren’t even though we’re dating). Another thing is, we’ve been talking since february, before we even MET that girl, so how is it fully her doing. It just really rubs me the wrong way and I want to call her out but is that rude? Am I overreacting about this?",

For context, I am a 23 year old woman living in my own place, financially independent, with a fiancée. The only thing that she can technically “hold” over me is that she put a down payment on my new car as a gift. \nSo I call my mom telling her about a concert I’m going to(my first concert too!). She asks me who I’m going with and I tell her a friend that she’s heard a bit about. Then she says, “I hope you didn’t pay for her ticket.” This was my mistake but when her tone gets like that, my people pleasing defense mechanism(that was built Because of hearing that tone all my life and getting punished for it) activated, and I said I didn’t to keep the peace. I didn’t want her to kick up a fuss about a $20 ticket that I bought with my own money. My mistake. Anyway, she continues to say that she doesn’t think I should be friends with someone “dumb and irresponsible” like my friend and that she doesn’t like me hanging out with her. My friend is also an adult and her crime in my mom’s eyes is having unprotected sex with her fiancé before marriage. She goes back to trying to convince me not to go. I understand that to some degree, since the concert will be held at night and there’s a possibility that I might end up going alone, but I want to go! I’ve been really excited for it and I thought this would be a great reward after killing it on my final exams at school. A light phone call about me telling her about a concert I was excited to go to turned into her basically berating me. Am I overreacting for thinking that my mom is still treating me like a child?",

Not getting paid Okay so I got this babysitting job from a local fb group, anyways met up with the little girl and her mom, they were nice, a couple weeks of watching her go by and things are going smooth and the mother is paying me as she said, now in the most recent weeks I’ve been watching her kid who is pretty wild sometimes and makes a ton of noise and jumps everywhere, I mean she’s a kid that’s gonna happen, but she like is rude to my cat, climbs on his towers and stuff when I tell her not to, my cat is scared of her atp and almost attacks her whenever she’s near, point is I am doing a lot watching her which will happen with a kid. Anyways last week her mom brought her here and she didn’t have the pay which I didn’t think much of because sometimes she brings it after she picks her up, but she came her and said she “forgot it” like how do you forget that lol, anyways that irritated me cause I took care of her kid for over 9 hours and she was being really wild that day and getting into lots of trouble, but she paid me back the week after with $10 extra, and she just brought her again and she didn’t have the pay ONCE AGAIN, she told me a while after she dropped her off that she couldn’t bring the pay later on, I’m pissed off now I have to watch her kid for hours for absolutely nothing to be earned from it, like I’m not babysitting for fun or for charity, I’m just irritated and feel like I can’t deal with this again honestly.",

    "text": "my (24f) boyfriend (33m) isn't introducing me to his mom. we've been dating for 3 months, AIO? Due to the age gap I'm pretty confused. My last boyfriend I dated since highschool, so this is my first \"adult\" relationship. Is it normal for me to not meet his mom? Like, he asks me to leave his house when she's coming over. It doesn't hurt my feelings yet but I don't know if it SHOULD. 3 months isn't a very long time at all but we do spend a lot of time together.... so I'm wondering if he's taking me seriously or not. Can a man in their 30s give me some insight on the typical mindset? I am pretty close with my family and hangout regularly so maybe I'm just too casual about him meeting mine? Help!\n\nTL;DR : my bf won't let me meet his mom and idk if that's weird!",

Over the summer I found out my boyfriend had been recieveing videos from women of their beasts and other privates. Never found any messages of him specifically asking but he did say he'd buy their OF if he could afford it and complimenting them. We talked about it and he said he wouldn't anymore and I believed him. Fast forward to 5 minutes ago. Curiosity got the better of me and what do I find? A video of a naked women in his messages that he saved in chat. Now before I do anything drastic, I need to know if it'll be overreacting if I leave him. Biggest issue currently is he just went thru some major health issues and his mind isn't quite right anymore so I feel bad leaving him. His vision is mostly gone so a job is difficult and disability has been a process to say the least. I'm very upset tho. AIO if I leave? If I leave he'll be homeless.",

HOWEVER, i told my dad about this production and he was the one that signed the audition form letting me… well… audition for the show.\n\nflash forward to thanksgiving, i bring up at the table that im playing a lead in pliant girls. my parents look really confused at each other and then back at me, and my dad says AND I QUOTE: ”…wait… you’re in another show?” i was a bit heartbroken and i look at my mom and she shrugs as well. my dad has in the past shrugged off my theatre accomplishments (i.e. after a really bad callback and when i was on the verge of tears he said “well at least you’ll get something.”) and so this hurt. tonight as well, i asked him if any of my extended family was seeing the show, to which he AGAIN looked bewildered and asked “whats pliant girls?..” to which i had to explain everything.\n\nthe reason im asking this is bc i KNOW it’s partly my fault they forgot, i kept it on the DL and my rehearsals are during school. however, this still hurts especially since my dad claims he is very involved in all aspects of my life (mostly work bc i don’t have a license and theatre.) am i overreacting? is this truly not a big deal?\n\nedit: thank you all so much for the comments, advice, and feedback, it means a lot to me. to clear some things up\n\n1: my dad does not have problems with his memory yet.\n\n2: i do already have a therapist and i will be talking with her about this too, ty for the suggestions\n\n3: no the play is not over and no i didn’t intentionally hide it from him, like him it slipped my mind because of the show i was already in.\n\n4: i will be putting all my stuff on the calendar, ty for the suggestion :)\n\n5: me and my dad both have horrendous social cue skills (we’re both autistic) so naturally miscommunications like this happen. i’m not saying this as an “i have autism card” im just pointing this out bc i left out crucial context.\n\n6: i probably will take this post down, so thank you for all the comments and not being rude to me, i’m just scared of people being genuinely rude or mean about the whole situation (and also the notifications) thank you so much again for all the advice i will keep this in mind :) as always, stay safe spread love and rock on 💜",

So she has a friend that she works with and I've been noticing some stuff that to me seems odd. Her friend who is also a female is always trying to be around her and has \"pretended\" to fall and grabbed her boob in the process. The friend has also given her gifts and stuff before and said she would buy her stuff if she had sex with her. Now my girlfriend has says she's not into her but they're always going out to the store together, or getting food, or going to the bank, etc. Meanwhile she never does that with me. The biggest thing I'm concerned about right now is that her friend is gonna be moving in with her now and I definitely have thoughts in the back of my head about what is gonna happen.",

    "text": "AIO think I'm married to a narcissist. Married for 4 years together almost 10. Have one biological hyperactive adhd boy (5) who I swear is on the spectrum (being tested for) and my son he chose to accept back at the age of 2 1/2. Now 12 . He has shown many, many signs of being a selfish narc. But didn't show them till our child we had together was about 2yo. He claimed his job stressed him out. So we moved across the US for a new job. That's when things FELL apart. \n\nHis anger he claims he over came, came out like a thousand hot daggers. The way he treats not only me, but our youngest and eldest is just. Toxic. He gets angry red hot over the smallest things. He's never \"hit\" anyone. But threatens spanking  the kids and will yank the youngest by his arm for timeouts, over the littlest thing. Which is yelling in his face at top notch with his loud booming voice and if im being real. I think there have been times he has slapped him on his bottom due to anger. Under circumstances, our fights have led to him belittling me, calling me names little B****. I told him are not acceptable as I never call him a jerk AH our D bag. Even when acting like one. He degrades the kids calling them dumb, stupid and spoiled. When they aren't. \n\n He thinks working all day at a salary job with a degree he chose, is so much that 5 minutes at home, while me being tapped out from handling everything else, is TOO MUCH.  He gets to play video games, leave to hang out with friends or a work function a drop of the dime. I never get out or even have friends. Because I'm a SAHM until our youngest is capable of going to school with occupational therapy to help him succeed. Even then I don't see me getting me time, ever in the future. He complains at my vices, when he was ready to quit the Same things, because he is ready. But I couldn't handle quitting them, if he did, because he was miserable to deal with and the kids. \n\nI'm the family mediator, care taker, makes all appointments unless it's his car or his health. He just doesn't seem to have wanted a family just the idea of it. And honestly wishing he just left me alone as a single mom back then doing my thing and succeeding. Now I'm states away from support and wondering what do I do. Thought I could suck it up and he would grow up. But he has only gotten worse. Many times I've thought about starting the back up plan to be supporting me and these boys so he can finally have his dream. A lazy bachelor doing whatever he wants but he always snaps to bread crumbs of small apologies and change, that he really didn't mean it. Am I over reacting or am I in a traumatic response? I'm asking because I don't have a ton of family who is mentally aware or would ever tell me what they think. I need a third out side party to see if this is red flag or am I just an iverwhekmed exhausted mom. \n\nSorry for typos/ grammer and ranting. I'm typing from phone and new to reddit. And I'm also at my millionth time of giving up and exhaustion. It's hitting the hardest as holidays are around the corner and this is a holiday meant to be about family and being thankful to have it. But things without detail are really crashing around from kiddos health to mine plus house issues in winter are piling up. \n\nPlease any opinions on my spewing out the littlest details would help. But if not I guess it feels good to get off my chest somewhere. \n\nEdit to add I'm very happy being a mom to these boys I chose to have. Even though it does get very overwhelming and stressful. I would never say I regret it or poor me. Just wish maybe the partner I thought I married turned out to be the man every devoted mother and wife end up with. I guess I'm seeing the mask slip, and I wonder, am I overreacting from past trauma, or does everyone else maybe outside of the world see little red flags, too?",

    "text": "AIO- Mad at my coworkers I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not, but honestly I'm considering quitting.\n\nSome food was placed in the breakroom from chick-fil-a. I went in a got a small box of chicken-minis. Shared one with another coworker and grabbed a biscuit and put it in my pocket. I've brought food more times than I can count, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nThe secretary came to me later and said,\" Someone took two things instead of one. There wasn't enough for everyone\" \n\nI was like, \"Yeah, I did that.\" I didn't know it was a certain number. Whenever I bring in food I bring in enough where there is Always extra.\n\nHer reply was that we were only supposed to take one. At no point did anyone say that to me.\n\nShe was like, \"Yeah I know, I placed one in my pocket. I can run up down and buy more.\" She said not too.\n\nAt that point of time another coworker overheard. They asked what was going on and she immediately told. So of course probably not even an hour later everyone in the office knew. I was super embarrassed.\n\nTo make up for it I brought in an entire sack of biscuits the next morning. I walked away and two of my coworkers started yelling that there was only 3 biscuits. I was like no way, I didn't count, but there should me at least 11 biscuits in the bag. I saw several of them heading to the breakroom so I thought maybe someone had placed them in the fridge. I when I got to the breakroom them pulled and was like, \"Nope they were just in my pocket!\"\n\nI turned around and left. One of the guys that was standing there, but not really involved came over afterwards. Told me he wasn't involved, but he was really sorry for what happened.\n\nThis next part might not really be involved in this story, but I wanted to lay everything out in the open. This next part I might be the one in the wrong.\n\nI'm friends with HR. She doesn't hang out with anyone outside of work, which I just always assume it's because she is HR. We do go to lunch some times and I call her my work sister.\n\nThe next day I hear she is having a get together with a couple of other ladies in the dept. Yes, they are all women with kids, but I was rather annoyed, because in the past she would never hang out with anyone outside of work. It was her idea for this get together and I did not get an invite. I'm a guy and I don't have kids, which is fair, but still annoyed me.\n\nSo I was already not in a good mood and this annoyed me when normally it wouldn't.. She started talking with me and when another coworker that was going to her house came up, she ignored me and started talking with them about the event. After 5 minutes I excused myself to go back to my desk. Later she came by and said, \"I said thank you for the biscuit yesterday, not sure why you have an attitude with me.\"\n\nI just kind mumbled K, I wasn't sure what that had to do with anything and I went back to work. \n\nLater came up and was talking to me about haircuts and how difficult it was to stay this beautiful as a woman and that it took a lot of maintenance. Still not in the mood I just kind rolled my eyes and replied, \"Whatever you want to tell yourself.\" Which caused my HR friend to go into a angry rant about me being grumpy. \n\nOne again HR and one of the coworker involved in the biscuit incident started talking about a coworker that was recently fired and other girl mentioned she was missing that fired coworker. I was just kind of like...\"ok\". I wasn't really that close with the person that got fired, he caused a lot of issues in the business, and the only reason he wasn't fired sooner was because he was friends with the boss. Not sure what he did to get fired, but it had to have been bad. Like stealing money, bad, at least that's my guess. The entire thing was very hush hush. HR friend was like \"You would miss OP if he was gone?\" to the girl that was. The other girl said she would miss me a lot. I just kind replied, \"I really don't care.\" I guess this is where I'm kind of in the wrong, but at this point I just kind of wanted them to leave me alone. It was clear I was in a bad mood and not ready to forgive anyone. \n\nHR yelled at me not to be so grumpy. My reply is \"I will feel how I want to feel, HR.\" About that time our boss walked over and we changed the subject.\n\nAIO? \n\nI just kind of feel done with everyone. I'm usually the happy positive one, so it has been super obvious to everyone I'm not happy with them, and they have been nice to me since then. \n\nI'm the guy you want on your projects with you because I'm really good at figuring things out and getting things done. I get great year end reviews, but after all of this I just want to leave. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but I feel humiliated and disrespected.",

    "text": "AIO for not getting a birthday gift of my choice? so hear me out everyone… \n\nI’m in a relationship with this person who is doing financially ok (and makes more than me). This will come in to play later in story. \n\nWe’ve been together for a while and normally we do typical things when it comes to birthday such as gifts and cake. normally the gifts have been nice (from my perspective). It could be things like nice lotions or maybe a new kitchen appliance. A lot of my gift request also tend to be things that we could share like a water filter.\n\nIn recent years, we normally have an Amazon wish list where we can just pick things. But this year was a little bit difficult. my birthday comes first in the calendar, and I remember having a variety of items on my list, including socks and underwear. The most expensive thing was probably the mini AI pet.\n\nI got a comment from my partner, which was that putting socks and underwear on my wish list wasn’t cool because those aren’t considered real gifts. Even though I would appreciate them. \n\nfast-forward, on the day of my birthday, my partner tells me that I will get a gift late this year, which is fine with me. Eventually, I was presented with a storage cart. It’s one of those things you build yourself and you can put stuff on it and you can wheel it around. Apparently that was my gift. And yes, I definitely was spoiled at this point even though I actually did like the item. And then the second item was a bedframe for my mattress (which I really didn’t need). I was a little bit letdown. And maybe I am really unappreciative \n\nI got a lecture afterwards saying that I should just appreciate what I got. Part of me feels a little hurt because I know this person will spend more money on their own family’s bday than mine. But also, this person has been lecturing me a lot more about how I live my life. \n\nA month later comes my partner’s birthday. I know this person did not update their wishlist, so I asked them what they wanted. I was told macbook, ipad, smart ring, remarkable pro… stuff that can go 1.2k and up…. \n\nAnd when I made a comment about how these are all luxury items… the response I got was “ Don’t worry about it then, I’ll get it myself someday.”\n\n that response hurt me deep. And I can’t forget it… this person makes a significant amount more than me, and they’ve been known to throw money away on things that don’t always make sense… whereas I’m the kind of person that has to count every dollar to make sure I can pay all the bills.. \n\nAt this point, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting … am I reading too much into the statement? what should i do? i can probably afford something from the list, but part of me feels sad that my partner didn’t want to treat me to something off my list… birthdays come once a year and i honestly feel i won’t have many more due to my health (separate story on that). :(",

    "text": "AIO my roommate has her fiancé practically living with us This has been something my roommate (Anna, 24F ) and I (23F) have been wanting to talk about with Gabby (24F). She started seeing this guy a few months back, and they’re pretty serious. We all moved in together a couple of months ago, but slowly her now fiancé “Mark” has been over more and more. They got engaged over a month ago. He’ll stay a bit in the morning when Gabby leaves for work and then come back in the evening when she comes back.\n\nHe tends to be over 4-5 days a week, and some of those days he sleeps over. We pay for gas and electric, so Anna and I had a plan to go over utilities and how they’re split. I got a notification on my xfinity app for 6 different websites trigging a security warning from his devices. I texted Anna, and sure enough, he’d been at the apartment all day without Gabby. The next day I was heading back to the apartment from being out of state for 2.5 weeks and the same thing. So I texted before she got back from work to see what’s going on and to express my concerns. \n\nAfter this text exchange she came back, and we all talked. Anna started the convo but Gabby started raising her voice and saying “I’m allowed whoever whenever I live here it’s also my lease.” She was also trying to say he was only over 2 days this week, which wasn’t true. The lease does clarify the only other occupants allowed are spouses of the tenant and children. Everyone else is considered a temporary visitor who is not entitled to the same lease rights. \n\nWe came to a “reasonable” conclusion: he can only stay until noon by the latest if he sleeps over on a work night, and Gabby has to chip in more for utilities to cover him. And he is allowed over 3 nights. I just found this whole thing wild; we didn’t sign up for 4 people living here we signed up for 3. We are going to monitor how often he is over now. AIO?",

He has also told me that she has a reputation for sleeping around the camp.\n\nHe then comes home a few weeks ago, and said he’s up for a promotion for good performance at work. Coincidentally, the day this came out, Brittany wants to sit with him at meal time and make friendly with him. He goes on to say “she isn’t that bad”.\n\nI told him that all of that is fucking weird. It’s weird that he went from saying she’s a bitch to being friendly, and it’s weird that she’s suddenly nice to him since he’s getting promoted. He thinks I’m crazy for thinking that and that nobody else would find this weird. So, am I overreacting?",

No warning, no conversation just went through it on her own. She found old texts with my ex from about six months ago from before we were exclusive and now she’s demanding explanations like I did something wrong.\n\nThe thing is I’m not even that defensive about the texts themselves. They were from a time when I was single and nothing in them crossed a line. What’s bothering me way more is the fact that she went through my phone while I was unconscious. That feels like a serious violation of privacy.\n\nNow the whole situation feels flipped. Instead of talking about why she felt it was okay to secretly go through my phone I’m being interrogated over something that happened before our relationship was defined.\n\nI was sitting on my balcony earlier trying to figure out if I’m being too sensitive but I can’t shake how uncomfortable this feels. The trust feels damaged and I’m not even the one who crossed the boundary first.\n\nAm I overreacting for being upset about this or is this actually a big deal?",

    "text": "AIO to my kids Christmas outfit not being prepped for her by the stay at home parent? My husband is a stay at home dad. I run a medium not for profit, it’s a busy job with lots of travel. We have 2 kids (4 and 7) and he gave up working after our eldest started school as his job couldn’t accommodate an early finish to match school hours (he worked a much lower paying job in admin so it made sense but I still recognise the sacrifice made). Both kids are now at school but I still have to be on top of everything and it is exhausting.\n\nThis week I have been leaving at 5am and getting home at around 8:30pm (except one day where I got home at 1am due to some bad traffic). When I get in I do bedtime with the kids and if the 4 year old wakes up in the night (which she usually does at least once) then I get up with her as he doesn’t hear her. (Giving this info for context).\n\nLast night he said he’d put a Christmas gift away he said it like he was currently doing it so I didn’t give it a second thought but for whatever reason he didn’t and this morning our daughter saw it. Frustrating and I expressed disappointment as it was something on her list so spoilt the Christmas magic a bit but who hasn’t gotten distracted on the way to do something. \n\nNext I reminded him it was her Christmas show. He’d already got it wrong earlier in the week despite a text message from me reminding him exactly what was needed. (He gets all the same information as I do from the school but doesn’t seem to log it, mentally or otherwise). He brought down the wrong outfit (it was a Christmas T-shirt and jeans which she wouldn’t have been allowed to wear) and said she didn’t have anything else. I went to look she did have other things but the outfit I knew she wanted to wear wasn’t put away or in the laundry. I told him I noticed he’d washed it yesterday and asked if he remembered what he’d done with it. He didn’t. This seemed to anger him but I eventually found the outfit he’d put it somewhere it wouldn’t usually go.\n\nNext her Christmas jumper was wet in the laundry and I couldn’t get it dry in the next 20 mins so that had to be skipped. \n\nFinally her Christmas antlers she’d chosen had been tidied away and he couldn’t remember what he’d done with them.\n\nBy this time I was just feed up. He was angrily following me around telling me I couldn’t do anything for myself (because I was asking where the things he’d put away literally yesterday were). Please bear in mind I found ever item myself, he maintained he couldn’t remember what he’d done with any of them but seemed to hate that I was asking him about it. \n\nBy this time I was late setting off, they were late for school and I was beyond fed up. Needless to say we ended up arguing with me asking why this wasn’t all sorted and why I was having to remind him of the laundry loads he’s done. I already do all the mental load but having to be his working memory as well was too much. Him saying it was just a dress and didn’t matter (it doesn’t to him, they frequently don’t have the things they need for school despite me sending morning reminders when I’m travelling). He continued that I was overreacting and that the only crime he’d committed was washing her clothes for her. \n\nTL/DR - husband stays home with the kids but isn’t on top of the school schedule, often leaving the kids without what they need and acts like I am high maintenance for expecting them to have what they need. \n\nAIO?",

It’s at my apartment, and I already bought extra food and the supplies for the craft night we were planning. It’s also the only time we are all available until January, because we’re in university together and in that weird gap between finals and the holidays.\n\nAbout an hour ago, one of the people said that he has a sore throat and can’t make it.

She said that I was being rude for wanting to exclude the other guy. The problem is, I haven’t seen them in about a month (still daily texting, just no in person hangouts even though each of us live literally 5 min away by walking) because he keeps cancelling. \n\nI asked if she would be willing if I asked if it was alright, and she just repeated that it would be rude to exclude him, but to ask anyways. I then texted him and asked if he would mind, and he said “of course not” and to bring him some cookies (we were planning on making them together!). She hasn’t responded to that yet, and we’re currently 30 min away from the time we were planning to meet up. \n\nIs it actually rude to keep the plans if someone cancels?? Or do they just not want to hang out with me? Am I overreacting for thinking that they don’t like me?",

For context, I am a 23 year old woman living in my own place, financially independent, with a fiancée. The only thing that she can technically “hold” over me is that she put a down payment on my new car as a gift. \nSo I call my mom telling her about a concert I’m going to(my first concert too!). She asks me who I’m going with and I tell her a friend that she’s heard a bit about. Then she says, “I hope you didn’t pay for her ticket.” This was my mistake but when her tone gets like that, my people pleasing defense mechanism(that was built Because of hearing that tone all my life and getting punished for it) activated, and I said I didn’t to keep the peace. I didn’t want her to kick up a fuss about a $20 ticket that I bought with my own money. My mistake. Anyway, she continues to say that she doesn’t think I should be friends with someone “dumb and irresponsible” like my friend and that she doesn’t like me hanging out with her. My friend is also an adult and her crime in my mom’s eyes is having unprotected sex with her fiancé before marriage. She goes back to trying to convince me not to go. I understand that to some degree, since the concert will be held at night and there’s a possibility that I might end up going alone, but I want to go! I’ve been really excited for it and I thought this would be a great reward after killing it on my final exams at school. A light phone call about me telling her about a concert I was excited to go to turned into her basically berating me. Am I overreacting for thinking that my mom is still treating me like a child?",

    "text": "AIO-My cousin (40sM) wants to visit me abroad and meet my friends (35F), but he has a long history of using and hurting women — including my own friends. My family says I’m “immature” for refusing. Am I wrong? I (35F) moved to Thailand recently, and my cousin (40sM) now wants to visit me, have me show him around, and meet my friends. Given his history, I told him no — and now my family is calling me immature and saying I should “grow up.” I need some outside perspective.\n\nMy cousin has a long, well-known pattern of treating women terribly. For decades, he’s done the same cycle:\n\n* pursue a woman intensely\n* pretend he’s in love\n* sleep with her for a few months\n* disappear\n* deny paternity if she gets pregnant until forced by court\n* get arrested for domestic violence\n* claim he loves her again\n* get her to bail him out\n* then leave for the next woman\n\nThis behavior started in his teens/20s and has continued into his 40s with no change.\n\nThe part that affects me personally: he specifically targets *my* friends. He has told me outright that he does it “because it’s fun.” He doesn’t do this with other cousins’ friends — only mine.\n\nHe has slept with several of my friends from back home, including:\n\n* my high school friend, who had a baby with him and was dumped a few months postpartum; he denied the child until court-ordered\n* another friend (also my bishop’s granddaughter), whom he publicly humiliated by bragging to the entire town\n\nHe would make comments in front of me like, “Better watch out, I might get another one,” or ask if my friends were single. Every time, I warned my friends about him and emphasized I didn’t want to be involved. Some ignored me, dated him secretly, and later came crying when everything blew up. I ended several friendships because of this pattern.\n\nMy family has always brushed it off. They say I shouldn’t “police” his love life, or that I’m overreacting. At one point they even accused me of being jealous. (For the record: absolutely not. Even if we weren’t related, I wouldn’t go near someone who treats women like that.)\n\nNow that I live abroad, he wants to come to Thailand and “meet my friends.” I told him no — I don’t want a repeat of losing friendships, dealing with drama, or watching him hurt more women.\n\nHe ran to the family about it, and now they’re telling me I’m immature, that his behavior is in the past, and that I need to “grow up” and host him. But the last time I was back home (just a year ago), he was still in and out of jail for domestic violence. Nothing has changed.\n\nI feel like I’m being pressured to put my own life and relationships at risk for someone who has never taken responsibility for anything. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to protect my friends — and myself — from someone with a proven decades-long pattern.\n\n**Would I be wrong for refusing to let him visit or meet my friends?**\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nMy cousin has a decades-long pattern of manipulating women, refusing to take responsibility for his children, and getting arrested for domestic violence — including hurting several of my past friends. He specifically targets *my* friends “because it’s fun.” Now he wants to visit me in Thailand and meet my new friends, and my family says I’m “immature” for saying no. I don’t want more drama or destroyed friendships. Am I wrong to refuse?",

    "text": "AIO MY(24M) GF(24F) KINDA CHEATED ON ME MONTHS AGO BUT NOT REALLY ? Hi, im a 24 year old male and in a relationship with my gf. We had some problem which i used a translate app to explain here so that there are no misunderstandings and i can get all the help and advices from you people. I dont think its forbidden in this community but if it is know that it is definitely real, my words, just translated from another language.\n\n  \nWe broke up three months ago, and it was a pretty messy breakup. About a month before we split, she had started talking to another guy. He messaged her on Instagram, and when I saw it, I warned her. I told her he clearly wasn’t trying to be “just friends,” but she didn’t believe me and even got upset with me. Later on, I messaged the guy myself and told him to back off.\n\nThen for about two weeks, while she was still with me, she kept meeting up with him. There wasn’t anything physical or emotional going on (according to her), but they did go out together. She even travelled to his hometown to meet him, drove around with him in his car, talked for hours, etc.\n\nOne night, while we were still together, she told me she was going to visit a female friend. Then she turned off her phone and stayed unreachable until around 11 PM. Later she admitted she had been sitting in a park with that guy the whole time. She told me all of this herself. She said she regretted it and that she only did it because our relationship had been going really badly at the time. She promised she would never do anything like that again as long as we were doing well.\n\nBut honestly… it still feels like a huge betrayal. And the worst part is that whatever was happening between them only ended because *he* stopped showing interest. If he hadn’t backed off, she probably would’ve ended up with him, and we would’ve never gotten back together. (We were broken up for 2 months and then reconciled.)\n\nThat night when she turned off her phone, I completely broke down. I had a panic attack, my friends had to help calm me down for hours. When she finally turned her phone back on and I confronted her yelled at her, she acted like I had no right to be upset. Even months later, when the topic came up, she tried to make me feel guilty about it—saying things like, “You hurt me so much by yelling at me. I felt horrible,” without acknowledging what she had been doing.I didnt know about the other guy at the time.\n\nOnce she even told me that there are no secrets between us and i know everything about her and what she's been doing since the breakup. There obviously were some secrets though.\n\nWhen she finally admitted everything and I connected all the pieces, it crushed me. Something in me just… broke. I developed this constant feeling of distrust. She’s been trying really hard to fix things and rebuild what she damaged, but I still feel awful throughout the day. If I don’t hear from her for even a minute, my mind immediately jumps to “Is she with someone else?” or “Is she pulling away from me?”\n\nRight now she’s abroad and can only reach me when she finds Wi-Fi—so every 2–3 hours. She tries to update me and reassure me, but I’m constantly stressed and anxious. It’s exhausting. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if what happened is actually serious.\n\nSo now im always anxious and always questioning her, where is he, what is she doing etc. She's trying to help but sometimes snaps at me.\n\n\n\nFor context, we’ve been together for 3 years: 1.5 years in the same city, 1.5 years long-distance but meeting every month. We’re even planning to get married next year and had already started preparing for it. But this whole situation resurfaced and completely shattered my trust. The fact that she hid all of this from me for so long makes it so hard to believe her now.",

    "text": "AIO to my friends' dads' comments (Written in September, posted in December)\nFor context, I (17f) am friends with a classmate (17f) and have been for going on 5 years. I've always been very close with her family, closer than with my own, and throughout that, anything I've disagreed with hasn't been enough to cause an actual drift in our relationship. Her father and I usually have somewhat different opinions on things, and maybe disagree on something small once a month, but it's not usually this big of a deal to me. The only other time when I have felt this hurt over something was an accumulation of multiple things that finally burst over last winter, and I can't even remember what they were.\n\nThe one that is still causing physical pain whenever I think about it happened about 1 1/2 months ago.\n\nOn the car ride to the lake, we'd (Me, my brother's friend, my friend's cousin, my friend's aunt, and my friend's mom) gotten into a conversation about how dolphins are actually terrible, mainly because male dolphins will surround a female dolphin and 'take turns', sometimes for multiple days at a time. Another thing that was brought up was how dolphins will play with puffer fish to get high off their toxins. I claimed that, really, only the male dolphins are terrible, because humans exploit other living things to get high all the time, so dolphins can't be in the wrong more than humans who cause harm consciously and still choose to continue.\n\nThis was brought up a few hours later while we (me, friends' dad, friends' uncle, their friend, and a couple of other girls that I can't exactly remember) were in the water, when about half of the family was there. I had thought about the conversation earlier, and I brought it up. I began talking about the whole dolphin thing, and I remember being interrupted the first time with him saying something about dolphins really just being terrible. He interrupts often, so I just continued finishing my thought about the whole pufferfish thing. He then said, I fuck you not, that I was \"jealous because I wanted a dolphin to rape me.\"\n\nWhat.\n\nThe.\n\nFuck.\n\nNow I have thought about this nearly every day since, trying to come up with any possible way I heard him wrong. I really wish I had just heard him wrong. But I didn't. \n\nI just stared at him. Like, how do you respond to that? I think I said something like \"are you serious\" or \"for real?\", trying to make it clear that this is when you apologize and take it back. He didn't. I tried to make it a bit by slowly backing out of the water, in a \"I'm leaving if you don't apologize' way, but in hindsight, not very funny, just really accurately expressed how uncomfortable I was. He said, \"I'm sorry it made you uncomfortable, but it was a joke. I'm not going to apologize because you don't find it funny.\"\n\nI felt like everyone was looking at me, and I finally gave in to the pressure and just started acting like everything was fine, and found a casual excuse to get out of the water without drawing attention or making people think something was wrong. \n\nI was just flabbergasted. Like really, that is the only accurate word or it. I went up to our stuff and sat down, and started talking to some of the friends that were there. I felt like I was going crazy, so I brought it up. The other girl there agreed it was a crazy thing to say, but we moved on.\n\nI would put more context about my relationship with my friend's family, but I really don't think I need to. In my mind, no amount of context could justify saying something like that and refusing to apologize for it. The family is self-labeled as emotionally healthy and mature, so I know they'll say I should talk to him about it, but with his memory issues and sometimes controversial sense of right and wrong, I can't imagine a scenario where this ends with an actual apology.",

But I spent $1000 on these Xmas cards (overkill I know but it was my first time sending them and I wanted them to be amazing!). The PDF is the proof I approved. I selected a dark red/wine color to make the photo pop and feel really festive. What I received instead was thanksgiving orange. The designer is claiming “reds are hard” and this is within the allowances for shade discrepancies but come on….at this price?? I would have been fine with a shade discrepancy if it had at least been like a bright cherry or apple red but this is pumpkin orange. AIO for expecting a partial credit/refund? They can’t reprint them since the photos are hand applied and it’s too close to Christmas.",

But she has a friend that I am concerned about and I'm not sure if i'm looking too far into it or if I have any basis to be worried. So she has a friend that she works with and I've been noticing some stuff that to me seems odd. Her friend who is also a female is always trying to be around her and has \"pretended\" to fall and grabbed her boob in the process. The friend has also given her gifts and stuff before and said she would buy her stuff if she had sex with her. Now my girlfriend has says she's not into her but they're always going out to the store together, or getting food, or going to the bank, etc. Meanwhile she never does that with me. The biggest thing I'm concerned about right now is that her friend is gonna be moving in with her now and I definitely have thoughts in the back of my head about what is gonna happen.",

Not getting paid Okay so I got this babysitting job from a local fb group, anyways met up with the little girl and her mom, they were nice, a couple weeks of watching her go by and things are going smooth and the mother is paying me as she said, now in the most recent weeks I’ve been watching her kid who is pretty wild sometimes and makes a ton of noise and jumps everywhere, I mean she’s a kid that’s gonna happen, but she like is rude to my cat, climbs on his towers and stuff when I tell her not to, my cat is scared of her atp and almost attacks her whenever she’s near, point is I am doing a lot watching her which will happen with a kid. Anyways last week her mom brought her here and she didn’t have the pay which I didn’t think much of because sometimes she brings it after she picks her up, but she came her and said she “forgot it” like how do you forget that lol, anyways that irritated me cause I took care of her kid for over 9 hours and she was being really wild that day and getting into lots of trouble, but she paid me back the week after with $10 extra, and she just brought her again and she didn’t have the pay ONCE AGAIN, she told me a while after she dropped her off that she couldn’t bring the pay later on, I’m pissed off now I have to watch her kid for hours for absolutely nothing to be earned from it, like I’m not babysitting for fun or for charity, I’m just irritated and feel like I can’t deal with this again honestly.",

Over the summer I found out my boyfriend had been recieveing videos from women of their beasts and other privates. Never found any messages of him specifically asking but he did say he'd buy their OF if he could afford it and complimenting them. We talked about it and he said he wouldn't anymore and I believed him. Fast forward to 5 minutes ago. Curiosity got the better of me and what do I find? A video of a naked women in his messages that he saved in chat. Now before I do anything drastic, I need to know if it'll be overreacting if I leave him. Biggest issue currently is he just went thru some major health issues and his mind isn't quite right anymore so I feel bad leaving him. His vision is mostly gone so a job is difficult and disability has been a process to say the least. I'm very upset tho. AIO if I leave? If I leave he'll be homeless.",

    "text": "AIO for wanting some privacy in my own home? my sister keeps coming over to my apartment without telling me first and I dont know why it suddenly started bothering me so much. At first I didnt care, but she does it pretty often now. Sometimes Im half asleep or in the middle of something and it just throws me off when she knocks out of nowhere.\n\nThe last time she came over I had been napping and I guess I sounded annoyed when I told her she should really let me know before coming. She didnt say much but she left kind of quickly. Later I heard from my mom that she’s upset and thinks I dont want her around.\n\nNow Im sitting here feeling guilty because I didnt mean it that way at all. I just like having a heads up before someone shows up. But now Im wondering if I made it bigger than it needed to be. Maybe I was tired and handled it badly. Maybe she took it more personally because of the way I said it. I cant tell anymore.\n\nSo yeah am I overthinking this whole situation or is it actually normal to want some privacy in your own home",

    "text": "AIO- Mad at my coworkers I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not, but honestly I'm considering quitting.\n\nSome food was placed in the breakroom from chick-fil-a. I went in a got a small box of chicken-minis. Shared one with another coworker and grabbed a biscuit and put it in my pocket. I've brought food more times than I can count, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nThe secretary came to me later and said,\" Someone took two things instead of one. There wasn't enough for everyone\" \n\nI was like, \"Yeah, I did that.\" I didn't know it was a certain number. Whenever I bring in food I bring in enough where there is Always extra.\n\nHer reply was that we were only supposed to take one. At no point did anyone say that to me.\n\nShe was like, \"Yeah I know, I placed one in my pocket. I can run up down and buy more.\" She said not too.\n\nAt that point of time another coworker overheard. They asked what was going on and she immediately told. So of course probably not even an hour later everyone in the office knew. I was super embarrassed.\n\nTo make up for it I brought in an entire sack of biscuits the next morning. I walked away and two of my coworkers started yelling that there was only 3 biscuits. I was like no way, I didn't count, but there should me at least 11 biscuits in the bag. I saw several of them heading to the breakroom so I thought maybe someone had placed them in the fridge. I when I got to the breakroom them pulled and was like, \"Nope they were just in my pocket!\"\n\nI turned around and left. One of the guys that was standing there, but not really involved came over afterwards. Told me he wasn't involved, but he was really sorry for what happened.\n\nThis next part might not really be involved in this story, but I wanted to lay everything out in the open. This next part I might be the one in the wrong.\n\nI'm friends with HR. She doesn't hang out with anyone outside of work, which I just always assume it's because she is HR. We do go to lunch some times and I call her my work sister.\n\nThe next day I hear she is having a get together with a couple of other ladies in the dept. Yes, they are all women with kids, but I was rather annoyed, because in the past she would never hang out with anyone outside of work. It was her idea for this get together and I did not get an invite. I'm a guy and I don't have kids, which is fair, but still annoyed me.\n\nSo I was already not in a good mood and this annoyed me when normally it wouldn't.. She started talking with me and when another coworker that was going to her house came up, she ignored me and started talking with them about the event. After 5 minutes I excused myself to go back to my desk. Later she came by and said, \"I said thank you for the biscuit yesterday, not sure why you have an attitude with me.\"\n\nI just kind mumbled K, I wasn't sure what that had to do with anything and I went back to work. \n\nLater came up and was talking to me about haircuts and how difficult it was to stay this beautiful as a woman and that it took a lot of maintenance. Still not in the mood I just kind rolled my eyes and replied, \"Whatever you want to tell yourself.\" Which caused my HR friend to go into a angry rant about me being grumpy. \n\nOne again HR and one of the coworker involved in the biscuit incident started talking about a coworker that was recently fired and other girl mentioned she was missing that fired coworker. I was just kind of like...\"ok\". I wasn't really that close with the person that got fired, he caused a lot of issues in the business, and the only reason he wasn't fired sooner was because he was friends with the boss. Not sure what he did to get fired, but it had to have been bad. Like stealing money, bad, at least that's my guess. The entire thing was very hush hush. HR friend was like \"You would miss OP if he was gone?\" to the girl that was. The other girl said she would miss me a lot. I just kind replied, \"I really don't care.\" I guess this is where I'm kind of in the wrong, but at this point I just kind of wanted them to leave me alone. It was clear I was in a bad mood and not ready to forgive anyone. \n\nHR yelled at me not to be so grumpy. My reply is \"I will feel how I want to feel, HR.\" About that time our boss walked over and we changed the subject.\n\nAIO? \n\nI just kind of feel done with everyone. I'm usually the happy positive one, so it has been super obvious to everyone I'm not happy with them, and they have been nice to me since then. \n\nI'm the guy you want on your projects with you because I'm really good at figuring things out and getting things done. I get great year end reviews, but after all of this I just want to leave. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but I feel humiliated and disrespected.",

Before anyone asks, yes this is a new account because I know how Redditors like to tussle. \n\nAnyway, my husband was on baby duty last night for our 7 month old. I’m a light sleeper so I usually wake up when the baby cries (his crib is in our room). I woke up once, my husband got up to give our son his pacifier. He goes back to bed, a few minutes later I wake up again only to see my husband punching himself in the face twice. I say “what the fuck??” And he’s like “what??” I ask him why he did that, and he’s like “the baby won’t go to sleep!!” \n\nI tell him I know he’s only gotten up once before this, ask him if he gave the baby his night bottle or changed him (he didn’t do either) and ask again why he did that. He scoffed and got up to do his actual night duties of changing/feeding him. \n\nWhen we got up this morning reiterated that I was very uncomfortable with how he reacted last night at the baby fussing, and that it’s the same thing every night, so idk why he reacted that way.

    "text": "AIO for telling the rep I support that he needs to split weekend coverage with me? I (F) work for a large medical device sales company. It’s just me and one primary rep covering our territory.\n\nRecently, it’s been treated as a given that I will cover every single weekend case if we have one (they are unpredictable and only happen in emergent cases / when our docs are on call). I brought up that I think we should split weekends instead of it always falling on me.\n\nHe’s technically my superior, but we’re both adults with full lives outside of work. Being an associate doesn’t mean my time is less valuable or that I’m an unlimited resource. He then told me that if I were a full rep as well, he would split weekends with me — but since I’m an associate, it “makes sense” that I take them.\n\nI honestly think that’s unfair. I’m still providing the same level of support in cases, the same availability, and the same workload during the week. The territory doesn’t function without both of us, and I don’t think hierarchy = automatic weekend dumping.\n\nI told him that expecting me to cover every weekend feels outdated and that I’m not willing to be taken advantage of. I’m not asking to opt out of weekends entirely — just for a reasonable, sustainable split.\n\nSo… AIO for pushing back and saying weekend coverage should be shared instead of me being the default person every time?",

    "text": "AIO Friend claims she’s responsible for my relationship Me and my boyfriend met in February at University and started hanging out nearly 4-5 times a week until May. At the time it was nothing serious and we both told eachother we didn’t want a relationship, as we both knew the semester was ending soon and that we would both have to go back to our home states which are across the country. \n\nOnce the semester ended, we stayed in touch all throughout the summer. We were both  hooking up with other people, but we would still call and text a lot to catch up. As soon as the new semester started, the absolute first night he moved in he asked me to sleepover because he wanted to see me so bad. I slept over and all was well and we continued to hang out daily since we were both back and happy to be with each other. We were still not exclusive and just in a talking stage for a while, and eventually I introduced him to some of my good friends that i had met in August. \n\nWe all got along super well at first and would hang out nightly in our dorms. My friends noticed how close me and this guy were and how we would act like a couple and they fully supported it and wanted us to actually be officially together. They would do some silly things like ask him how he felt about me or if he wanted to be with me, and it got us pretty much nowhere because he would just say he liked me but wasn’t ready for a relationship (which i already knew). We all continued hanging out in a group and eventually took a trip together. Over this trip, things developed and me and him started getting a lot closer. He started sleeping over every night, and we eventually started dating and fell in love rather quickly. \n\nNow, back to my friends. They’ve been kind of weird this whole relationship. We’re young so this next part may sound juvenile but somethings i noticed was one of my friends added him on snapchat and asked him to add her back (he reluctantly did because we were all friends). She asked me if her snapping him would make me uncomfortable and I told her honestly that it would bug me a bit if they consistently snap chatted every day, so she promised she wouldn’t and said she understood. Flash forward a few weeks later, she has a streak with him and is sending him videos of her and her friend rubbing their feet together in foot masks? It was so bizarre they didn’t send that video to me, just him, and brought it up infront of me. He agrees this was weird and stopped snapping them because that was just icky. Something else to keep in mind is that when we all hung out, I used to sit next to him on one of our beds, but then before we started dating we were not allowed to sit together because my friends freak out and get uncomfortable and kind of throw digs at us.  \n\nThis friend is now claiming that she’s the reason we’re happily together and says it’s “genuinely because of her that we’re together and dating” but in my view, while she may have helped us get together through just agreeing to group hangouts or maybe doing some setups (i can’t even think of any right now), but barely considering we weren’t even allowed to sit next to eachother (still aren’t even though we’re dating). Another thing is, we’ve been talking since february, before we even MET that girl, so how is it fully her doing. It just really rubs me the wrong way and I want to call her out but is that rude? Am I overreacting about this?",

HOWEVER, i told my dad about this production and he was the one that signed the audition form letting me… well… audition for the show.\n\nflash forward to thanksgiving, i bring up at the table that im playing a lead in pliant girls. my parents look really confused at each other and then back at me, and my dad says AND I QUOTE: ”…wait… you’re in another show?” i was a bit heartbroken and i look at my mom and she shrugs as well. my dad has in the past shrugged off my theatre accomplishments (i.e. after a really bad callback and when i was on the verge of tears he said “well at least you’ll get something.”) and so this hurt. tonight as well, i asked him if any of my extended family was seeing the show, to which he AGAIN looked bewildered and asked “whats pliant girls?..” to which i had to explain everything.\n\nthe reason im asking this is bc i KNOW it’s partly my fault they forgot, i kept it on the DL and my rehearsals are during school. however, this still hurts especially since my dad claims he is very involved in all aspects of my life (mostly work bc i don’t have a license and theatre.) am i overreacting? is this truly not a big deal?\n\nedit: thank you all so much for the comments, advice, and feedback, it means a lot to me. to clear some things up\n\n1: my dad does not have problems with his memory yet.\n\n2: i do already have a therapist and i will be talking with her about this too, ty for the suggestions\n\n3: no the play is not over and no i didn’t intentionally hide it from him, like him it slipped my mind because of the show i was already in.\n\n4: i will be putting all my stuff on the calendar, ty for the suggestion :)\n\n5: me and my dad both have horrendous social cue skills (we’re both autistic) so naturally miscommunications like this happen. i’m not saying this as an “i have autism card” im just pointing this out bc i left out crucial context.\n\n6: i probably will take this post down, so thank you for all the comments and not being rude to me, i’m just scared of people being genuinely rude or mean about the whole situation (and also the notifications) thank you so much again for all the advice i will keep this in mind :) as always, stay safe spread love and rock on 💜",

I saw my face and my friends’ faces on the vlog, but I cannot figure out who shot the videos. It was a very small event, I think we were just six people who attended the event. \n\nWhen I scrolled through my gallery, I figured out that it was that one guy who was wearing specs with built in camera. \n\nAIO for being mad? First, he didnt ask for permission to take videos of us, let alone post us on his social media without blurring our faces. Second, we had no idea he was recording, and my friends and I were talking about some topics not meant to be heard by people outside the group. Though there was no audio on his vlog, but still, he recorded the whole workshop. Is that an ethical vlogging practice?",

    "text": "AIO think I'm married to a narcissist. Married for 4 years together almost 10. Have one biological hyperactive adhd boy (5) who I swear is on the spectrum (being tested for) and my son he chose to accept back at the age of 2 1/2. Now 12 . He has shown many, many signs of being a selfish narc. But didn't show them till our child we had together was about 2yo. He claimed his job stressed him out. So we moved across the US for a new job. That's when things FELL apart. \n\nHis anger he claims he over came, came out like a thousand hot daggers. The way he treats not only me, but our youngest and eldest is just. Toxic. He gets angry red hot over the smallest things. He's never \"hit\" anyone. But threatens spanking  the kids and will yank the youngest by his arm for timeouts, over the littlest thing. Which is yelling in his face at top notch with his loud booming voice and if im being real. I think there have been times he has slapped him on his bottom due to anger. Under circumstances, our fights have led to him belittling me, calling me names little B****. I told him are not acceptable as I never call him a jerk AH our D bag. Even when acting like one. He degrades the kids calling them dumb, stupid and spoiled. When they aren't. \n\n He thinks working all day at a salary job with a degree he chose, is so much that 5 minutes at home, while me being tapped out from handling everything else, is TOO MUCH.  He gets to play video games, leave to hang out with friends or a work function a drop of the dime. I never get out or even have friends. Because I'm a SAHM until our youngest is capable of going to school with occupational therapy to help him succeed. Even then I don't see me getting me time, ever in the future. He complains at my vices, when he was ready to quit the Same things, because he is ready. But I couldn't handle quitting them, if he did, because he was miserable to deal with and the kids. \n\nI'm the family mediator, care taker, makes all appointments unless it's his car or his health. He just doesn't seem to have wanted a family just the idea of it. And honestly wishing he just left me alone as a single mom back then doing my thing and succeeding. Now I'm states away from support and wondering what do I do. Thought I could suck it up and he would grow up. But he has only gotten worse. Many times I've thought about starting the back up plan to be supporting me and these boys so he can finally have his dream. A lazy bachelor doing whatever he wants but he always snaps to bread crumbs of small apologies and change, that he really didn't mean it. Am I over reacting or am I in a traumatic response? I'm asking because I don't have a ton of family who is mentally aware or would ever tell me what they think. I need a third out side party to see if this is red flag or am I just an iverwhekmed exhausted mom. \n\nSorry for typos/ grammer and ranting. I'm typing from phone and new to reddit. And I'm also at my millionth time of giving up and exhaustion. It's hitting the hardest as holidays are around the corner and this is a holiday meant to be about family and being thankful to have it. But things without detail are really crashing around from kiddos health to mine plus house issues in winter are piling up. \n\nPlease any opinions on my spewing out the littlest details would help. But if not I guess it feels good to get off my chest somewhere. \n\nEdit to add I'm very happy being a mom to these boys I chose to have. Even though it does get very overwhelming and stressful. I would never say I regret it or poor me. Just wish maybe the partner I thought I married turned out to be the man every devoted mother and wife end up with. I guess I'm seeing the mask slip, and I wonder, am I overreacting from past trauma, or does everyone else maybe outside of the world see little red flags, too?",

I jokingly promised I wouldn’t go and look at all his nudes, etc. and after a preliminary glance he agreed to let me find the video and send it to myself because he was driving and I wanted the pic before he dropped me off.\n\nI had no intention of finding any thing else. I’m not trying to be lied to, but I wanted to trust him. And maybe I still should. When I found the video and clicked “share” however, I noticed something strange. The first suggested contact was me, I’m in his phone with a nickname and a stock photo that is a sort of inside joke. But then I saw the second suggested contact. There was a full picture of this person. They had their name, a nickname, and an emoji. It’s also imprtant to say my bf has a type and both me and this person (from their picture) are the same “type” . \n\nThis wouldn’t bother me. My bf has work relationships and old friends I don’t know. But he has never mentioned this person to me ever. They have a distinct name I would obviously remember and they live in our neighborhood and are also gay. All the things that would and should make us friends but instead I know nothing. \n\nI tried to let the whole situation go. Sent myself the picture and then sat there quietly. He noticed my shift in attitude and asked what’s up. I simply said I shouldn’t have looked in his phone and he got mad. Told me he needs boundaries and he doesn’t like being accused of things. Mind you I hadn’t accused him of anything. Just said I shouldn’t have looked in his phone and left it there. He dropped me off and I looked up the guys ig. He’s friends and followers with several of my friends, but not me. I think I am done with my bf. AIO?",

We left it at that until I text him today asking this. Sure sex was brought up until he mentioned he doesn’t use condoms 🥴 \n\nI figured us getting to know each other for 2 months without sex was enough grounds to at least just stay platonic friends but I guess not.

    "text": "AIO for not getting a birthday gift of my choice? so hear me out everyone… \n\nI’m in a relationship with this person who is doing financially ok (and makes more than me). This will come in to play later in story. \n\nWe’ve been together for a while and normally we do typical things when it comes to birthday such as gifts and cake. normally the gifts have been nice (from my perspective). It could be things like nice lotions or maybe a new kitchen appliance. A lot of my gift request also tend to be things that we could share like a water filter.\n\nIn recent years, we normally have an Amazon wish list where we can just pick things. But this year was a little bit difficult. my birthday comes first in the calendar, and I remember having a variety of items on my list, including socks and underwear. The most expensive thing was probably the mini AI pet.\n\nI got a comment from my partner, which was that putting socks and underwear on my wish list wasn’t cool because those aren’t considered real gifts. Even though I would appreciate them. \n\nfast-forward, on the day of my birthday, my partner tells me that I will get a gift late this year, which is fine with me. Eventually, I was presented with a storage cart. It’s one of those things you build yourself and you can put stuff on it and you can wheel it around. Apparently that was my gift. And yes, I definitely was spoiled at this point even though I actually did like the item. And then the second item was a bedframe for my mattress (which I really didn’t need). I was a little bit letdown. And maybe I am really unappreciative \n\nI got a lecture afterwards saying that I should just appreciate what I got. Part of me feels a little hurt because I know this person will spend more money on their own family’s bday than mine. But also, this person has been lecturing me a lot more about how I live my life. \n\nA month later comes my partner’s birthday. I know this person did not update their wishlist, so I asked them what they wanted. I was told macbook, ipad, smart ring, remarkable pro… stuff that can go 1.2k and up…. \n\nAnd when I made a comment about how these are all luxury items… the response I got was “ Don’t worry about it then, I’ll get it myself someday.”\n\n that response hurt me deep. And I can’t forget it… this person makes a significant amount more than me, and they’ve been known to throw money away on things that don’t always make sense… whereas I’m the kind of person that has to count every dollar to make sure I can pay all the bills.. \n\nAt this point, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting … am I reading too much into the statement? what should i do? i can probably afford something from the list, but part of me feels sad that my partner didn’t want to treat me to something off my list… birthdays come once a year and i honestly feel i won’t have many more due to my health (separate story on that). :(",

He said yes. Last week the professor reminded me that the term for us is in the few weeks. The guy I’m supposed to work with isn’t very actively attending the lectures. I messaged him (for the first time) asking if he remembers abt it and that I can do it myself for us both during the christmas weekend. He didn’t respond so I sent him a friend request too. \nAt the same time he was chatting on group chat so he must’ve seen the notifications. \n\nAt first I thought he’ll respond later but after a few days of no reply from him, I realised he’s just being sassy because of our little argument 2 months ago. He has a thing for touching girls without consent. 2 months ago I snapped at him in public after he grabbed me by my arm (again) while talking, it wasn’t the first time he just looked for a reason to do so. Since then we didn’t talked like, at all, but I didn’t care abt it too because we don’t have to be friends. \n\n(side note: he’s still touching other girls A LOT and they’re all pretty much upset but they’re also younger than me and lack the back bone to tell him something. he touches their faces or necks, grabs by the arms from behind etc. he’s a creep.)\n\nToday I wanted to ask him directly why isn’t he replying because it’s just the work we have to do and that if he’s so upset then we can work separately on different subjects. I just wanted it done. But the first thing he did after coming to our group on the hallway was shaking hands with everyone BUT me, instead he grabbed my head from behind and stroked it aggressively, without saying anything. \nI gasped, turned around and called him out, saying he has no right to touch me and he knows that because I already told him once. He just walked away smirking without saying anything. \n\nWe’re both close age - late first year students - and I’ve already dealt with shit like that in my previous workplaces. \nRight after coming home I emailed the professor asking that due to no contact with the other student from my group, I want to be assigned to other theme for the project that I’d like to do alone. \nI didn’t told/text him anything, but now I’m wondering if I won’t come off as overreacting when she informs him about that. I guess she will tell him that he’s working alone or ask why sooner or later. \nAIO?",

So I’ve (24F) had this friend since high school (25F) and she’s always kinda been a me me me girl, always talking about herself, her problems whatever and like I was fine with it cause I mean I kinda just went with the flow back in high school and I’m not generally too much of a yapper. But we went to different colleges and stopped hanging out as much (which again is fine.) But I started to feel like every time I went back to the city and asked her if she wanted to hang out and made plans (which she agreed to) she’d always back out and say “oh well my boyfriend is doing this so I’m going to hang out with him and his friends” or “my boyfriend can’t give me a ride so I can’t go” and would always follow up by saying “oh but we’re going to be here so you can hang out with us instead if you want” \n\nBro when I tell you I HATE hanging out with her boyfriend and his friends. Why? Cause this man is 40 fkn years old. A grown ass man and every time I’ve hung out with this grown ass man and his grown ass men friends they’d get the bright ass idea that bc she’s dating a grown ass man that I would want to too. \n\nFUUCK NO. \n\nALSO why the hell do you need a ride WHEN WE LIVE IN NYC, take the damn train. \n\nAnyways crashout aside I got fed up with it and just stopped inviting her to shit. So we haven’t spoken now in a couple months (maybe even longer I stopped keeping track) and out of the blue she calls me crying “hey how are you, it’s been so long, what’s new? We need to hang out.” And then proceeds to dump on me all the relationship issues they have been having for the past 5-6 years oh and did I mention this man has a whole ass kid, not half a child, a whole fucking child ANNND that he’s known her since we were at least in senior year of high school. Just a lil tid bit of information. I was always like whatever it’s not my business she’s always been the type to care about how “mature” she is and say shit to me like “oh you’re the only friend I have my age” like that was a flex? \n\nBut idk I got roped into scheduling a day during Christmas week to hang out with her since I’d be back in the city and my mom said “absolutely not. She’s not going to get in the way of my mother daughter time” and I that I need to stop picking up strays bc I’m too sympathetic to the problems of others 😅 which I mean yes but it’s just easier said than done to just drop somebody especially since I’ve known her for so long. \n\nIdk I feel like maybe just maybe I see a tiny sliver of the girl I was friends with that wasn’t attached to the hip of her mans but also I should probably just cut my losses and move on… idk I need help. Ofc it’s not my responsibility to play therapist and fix her life but also I just idk i feel like my friends are dropping like flies, i probably just need to make friend with more stable people but again easier said than done 😭",

I found out through my cousin, who told me that my dad had a child with his aunt (his mom’s sister). For my dad, baby mama was basically the sister of his brother’s wife. What really hit me was learning that everyone on my dad’s side of the family already knew about this. Literally everyone except my siblings and me. My cousin even said my mom knew, which shocked me because my mom always said she’d never forgive a man for something like that. It was a lot to process. There were so many times I wanted to confront them and just let out all the anger I had, but I felt like doing that would completely destroy our family. So I stayed silent for a whole a$$ year. About 2 months ago, after some things happened, I finally asked my mom why she never told me. That’s when I found out she actually had no idea about any of it. I ended up telling her in the worst way possible because I didn’t have the full context. As you can imagine, she blew up and kicked my dad out of the house. And ever since then, my dad’s family (who are basically my mom’s only nearby family too, since her relatives live abroad) has been calling and messaging me nonstop. They keep trying to convince me to talk to my mom so she can forgive my dad, saying things like “it was a mistake from the past” or “you can’t throw away a 25-year marriage just like that.”\n\nThe truth is, I’m still angry. Not just at my dad, but at my cousins, uncles, everyone who kept this secret from us for 18 years. I’m not talking to any of them right now.\n\nWhat I’m struggling with is this:\nAIO for telling my mom the truth the way I did? And should I even try to convince her to forgive him?",

Posting stories. Commenting on things. Clearly on their phones.\n\nSo they're not busy. They're just not prioritizing responding to me.\n\nI know people don't owe instant replies. But when it's consistent and when I can see they're online doing other things, it starts to feel intentional.\n\nLike I'm not important enough to warrant 30 seconds of their time.\n\nAm I being insecure? Or is this a valid thing to feel hurt about?\n\nBecause on one hand everyone has their own communication style. On the other hand if someone matters to you, you make time. Even just a quick \"hey, busy right now but I'll reply later\"\n\nBut being dead silent while they're actively posting feels like a statement.\n\nI was chilling in my kitchen playing grizzly's quest to distract myself but I kept checking back to see if they'd opened my message from 12 hours ago. They hadn't. Made me wonder if I'm overthinking or if this friendship is just one sided.\n\nSo am I overreacting? Or is this actually disrespectful?",

    "text": "AIO for snapping at my GF (26F) after she threw me under the bus to her mom for not helping her move? I (27M) need an outside perspective on this because I feel like I’m going crazy.\n\nContext: My girlfriend (26F) and I both started school around the same time. My program was online, hers was in-person, so her work hours got cut. We had an agreement that she’d keep paying her usual $700/month towards the mortgage.\n\nWell, after her second month of school, the payments just stopped. I tried to be understanding. I told her, \"Just let me know in advance what you can or can’t pay so I can budget for us.\" She never did. Instead, every time I brought it up, she’d get mad at me to shut down the conversation. It’s been a full year now, and she hasn’t paid a dime.\n\nThe frustrating part isn't even the rent itself, it’s that she hasn’t adjusted her lifestyle at all. While I’m paying for the mortgage, bills, food, and literally everything else, she’s still spending a crazy amount on Starbucks and running up my credit card on unnecessary stuff. She actually just graduated a month ago, and for Thanksgiving, she dropped hundreds of dollars so her family could have a \"great Thanksgiving.\" Meanwhile, I’ve been stressing to her constantly about how tight money is for me right now because I'm carrying both of us.\n\nShe recently took a travel nursing position all the way across the country. She wanted me to go out there to help her get settled in. I told her the truth: I literally don’t have the funds to make that trip because I’ve been drained paying for everything for the last year.\n\nShe got pissed. She immediately called her mom while I was standing right there and threw me under the bus. She said, “He told me he’s not helping me move in,” using this tone that made me sound like a completely unsupportive partner. She gave zero context on why I couldn't go (aka, I'm broke from supporting her).\n\nAfter she hung up, I snapped. I’m not proud of it, but it was my breaking point after a year of not being heard or understood. I raised my voice and let all that frustration out.\n\nAIO?\n\nEdit: There’s a lot of detail here and I know I probably missed some things since I'm writing this while frustrated, so let me know in the comments if I need to explain anything else.",

    "text": "AIO for Amazon delivery driver's reaction after my wife didn't let them into our building My wife was taking the dog out one evening (5:30p, already dark out)and an Amazon delivery driver was nearby looking for our apartment building. He already seemed pretty annoyed that he couldn't immediately find the entrance. But once he found the entrance, he asked my wife who was already walking away if she could open the door for him.   \n  \nNow for context, normally Amazon deliveries get left behind the first metal door, in front of the mailboxes before the locked door. It's rare for packages to go missing because of cameras and not being easily visible in the very small lobby. As you've surmised from the title, my wife said \"No sorry, but you can leave the package behind the first door and I'll bring them in when I get back.\" It's dark out, below freezing temps, with an old 16 y.o. dog. So she wasn't going to be out long anyway. He then started to tell yell at her \"I'm wearing an Amazon uniform. I'm just trying to deliver your packages. I'm not going to do anything to you!\" We don't have an Amazon account, and those deliveries weren't for us.   \n  \nMy wife walked away at this point and our doorbell camera caught his reaction afterwards. I won't be posting the video on here, but will give a description of what happened. He called her a bitch and even a \"retard,\" which we can both write off as holiday-delivery stress. We're both not soft-skinned people and have grown up in rough neighborhoods. The actual recipient he was trying to deliver to actually came down to get the package from him, and he apologized to THEM for his reaction. They exchanged a few words after But I draw the line at the end of the clip when he walks away laughing saying \"I would've violated her whole shit.\" Where we come from, that could mean any number of things, and I take threats like this seriously.\n\nSo, am I overacting for wanting to make a formal report to Amazon about this type of behavior? I don't support people losing jobs right before the holidays, but considering the situation of her being alone after dark, and being yelled at by an agitated larger man, and If he had just waited another minute for the tenant to respond, the package would've been safely delivered anyway. I think this type of behavior is unacceptable.",

    "text": "AIO: Am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable that my boyfriend wants to make a new female friend? I (29F) am really confused and would love some outside opinions.\n\nMy boyfriend (29M) recently mentioned that he wants to “make a new friend,” and specifically said he’d like that friend to be a woman. There’s no one in the picture yet — he just expressed the desire to have a female friend in general. He clarified that it would be just platonic and nothing else. But for some reason, this is bothering me more than I expected.\n\nTo add context he's a really great boyfriend to me and he has never done anything for me to doubt him for. He's very open and honest and doesn't shy away from answering any of my questions. Like ever.\n\nIt’s not that I think people can’t have opposite-sex friends — I know that’s normal. But something about him specifically wanting to form a new friendship with another woman when he already has me makes me feel uneasy and honestly kind of hurt.\n\nIt makes me wonder why he feels the need to build a new connection with another woman. Is that normal? Is it harmless? Or is it an early sign of emotional cheating?\n\nI’ve told him it makes me uncomfortable, but he insists I shouldn’t feel threatened and that I’m overthinking. I’m not trying to be controlling, but I also can’t shake this feeling in my gut. \n\nI have been raised in a very traditional family with traditional values. However I'm not a close minded person. Usually I don't have a problem with any of his friends, men and women alike. \n\nAm I overreacting? Is this a valid concern? What boundaries are normal here? Would this bother you too?",

    "text": "AIO to my friends' dads' comments (Written in September, posted in December)\nFor context, I (17f) am friends with a classmate (17f) and have been for going on 5 years. I've always been very close with her family, closer than with my own, and throughout that, anything I've disagreed with hasn't been enough to cause an actual drift in our relationship. Her father and I usually have somewhat different opinions on things, and maybe disagree on something small once a month, but it's not usually this big of a deal to me. The only other time when I have felt this hurt over something was an accumulation of multiple things that finally burst over last winter, and I can't even remember what they were.\n\nThe one that is still causing physical pain whenever I think about it happened about 1 1/2 months ago.\n\nOn the car ride to the lake, we'd (Me, my brother's friend, my friend's cousin, my friend's aunt, and my friend's mom) gotten into a conversation about how dolphins are actually terrible, mainly because male dolphins will surround a female dolphin and 'take turns', sometimes for multiple days at a time. Another thing that was brought up was how dolphins will play with puffer fish to get high off their toxins. I claimed that, really, only the male dolphins are terrible, because humans exploit other living things to get high all the time, so dolphins can't be in the wrong more than humans who cause harm consciously and still choose to continue.\n\nThis was brought up a few hours later while we (me, friends' dad, friends' uncle, their friend, and a couple of other girls that I can't exactly remember) were in the water, when about half of the family was there. I had thought about the conversation earlier, and I brought it up. I began talking about the whole dolphin thing, and I remember being interrupted the first time with him saying something about dolphins really just being terrible. He interrupts often, so I just continued finishing my thought about the whole pufferfish thing. He then said, I fuck you not, that I was \"jealous because I wanted a dolphin to rape me.\"\n\nWhat.\n\nThe.\n\nFuck.\n\nNow I have thought about this nearly every day since, trying to come up with any possible way I heard him wrong. I really wish I had just heard him wrong. But I didn't. \n\nI just stared at him. Like, how do you respond to that? I think I said something like \"are you serious\" or \"for real?\", trying to make it clear that this is when you apologize and take it back. He didn't. I tried to make it a bit by slowly backing out of the water, in a \"I'm leaving if you don't apologize' way, but in hindsight, not very funny, just really accurately expressed how uncomfortable I was. He said, \"I'm sorry it made you uncomfortable, but it was a joke. I'm not going to apologize because you don't find it funny.\"\n\nI felt like everyone was looking at me, and I finally gave in to the pressure and just started acting like everything was fine, and found a casual excuse to get out of the water without drawing attention or making people think something was wrong. \n\nI was just flabbergasted. Like really, that is the only accurate word or it. I went up to our stuff and sat down, and started talking to some of the friends that were there. I felt like I was going crazy, so I brought it up. The other girl there agreed it was a crazy thing to say, but we moved on.\n\nI would put more context about my relationship with my friend's family, but I really don't think I need to. In my mind, no amount of context could justify saying something like that and refusing to apologize for it. The family is self-labeled as emotionally healthy and mature, so I know they'll say I should talk to him about it, but with his memory issues and sometimes controversial sense of right and wrong, I can't imagine a scenario where this ends with an actual apology.",

    "text": "AIO- Mad at my coworkers I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not, but honestly I'm considering quitting.\n\nSome food was placed in the breakroom from chick-fil-a. I went in a got a small box of chicken-minis. Shared one with another coworker and grabbed a biscuit and put it in my pocket. I've brought food more times than I can count, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nThe secretary came to me later and said,\" Someone took two things instead of one. There wasn't enough for everyone\" \n\nI was like, \"Yeah, I did that.\" I didn't know it was a certain number. Whenever I bring in food I bring in enough where there is Always extra.\n\nHer reply was that we were only supposed to take one. At no point did anyone say that to me.\n\nShe was like, \"Yeah I know, I placed one in my pocket. I can run up down and buy more.\" She said not too.\n\nAt that point of time another coworker overheard. They asked what was going on and she immediately told. So of course probably not even an hour later everyone in the office knew. I was super embarrassed.\n\nTo make up for it I brought in an entire sack of biscuits the next morning. I walked away and two of my coworkers started yelling that there was only 3 biscuits. I was like no way, I didn't count, but there should me at least 11 biscuits in the bag. I saw several of them heading to the breakroom so I thought maybe someone had placed them in the fridge. I when I got to the breakroom them pulled and was like, \"Nope they were just in my pocket!\"\n\nI turned around and left. One of the guys that was standing there, but not really involved came over afterwards. Told me he wasn't involved, but he was really sorry for what happened.\n\nThis next part might not really be involved in this story, but I wanted to lay everything out in the open. This next part I might be the one in the wrong.\n\nI'm friends with HR. She doesn't hang out with anyone outside of work, which I just always assume it's because she is HR. We do go to lunch some times and I call her my work sister.\n\nThe next day I hear she is having a get together with a couple of other ladies in the dept. Yes, they are all women with kids, but I was rather annoyed, because in the past she would never hang out with anyone outside of work. It was her idea for this get together and I did not get an invite. I'm a guy and I don't have kids, which is fair, but still annoyed me.\n\nSo I was already not in a good mood and this annoyed me when normally it wouldn't.. She started talking with me and when another coworker that was going to her house came up, she ignored me and started talking with them about the event. After 5 minutes I excused myself to go back to my desk. Later she came by and said, \"I said thank you for the biscuit yesterday, not sure why you have an attitude with me.\"\n\nI just kind mumbled K, I wasn't sure what that had to do with anything and I went back to work. \n\nLater came up and was talking to me about haircuts and how difficult it was to stay this beautiful as a woman and that it took a lot of maintenance. Still not in the mood I just kind rolled my eyes and replied, \"Whatever you want to tell yourself.\" Which caused my HR friend to go into a angry rant about me being grumpy. \n\nOne again HR and one of the coworker involved in the biscuit incident started talking about a coworker that was recently fired and other girl mentioned she was missing that fired coworker. I was just kind of like...\"ok\". I wasn't really that close with the person that got fired, he caused a lot of issues in the business, and the only reason he wasn't fired sooner was because he was friends with the boss. Not sure what he did to get fired, but it had to have been bad. Like stealing money, bad, at least that's my guess. The entire thing was very hush hush. HR friend was like \"You would miss OP if he was gone?\" to the girl that was. The other girl said she would miss me a lot. I just kind replied, \"I really don't care.\" I guess this is where I'm kind of in the wrong, but at this point I just kind of wanted them to leave me alone. It was clear I was in a bad mood and not ready to forgive anyone. \n\nHR yelled at me not to be so grumpy. My reply is \"I will feel how I want to feel, HR.\" About that time our boss walked over and we changed the subject.\n\nAIO? \n\nI just kind of feel done with everyone. I'm usually the happy positive one, so it has been super obvious to everyone I'm not happy with them, and they have been nice to me since then. \n\nI'm the guy you want on your projects with you because I'm really good at figuring things out and getting things done. I get great year end reviews, but after all of this I just want to leave. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but I feel humiliated and disrespected.",

    "text": "AIO to my kids Christmas outfit not being prepped for her by the stay at home parent? My husband is a stay at home dad. I run a medium not for profit, it’s a busy job with lots of travel. We have 2 kids (4 and 7) and he gave up working after our eldest started school as his job couldn’t accommodate an early finish to match school hours (he worked a much lower paying job in admin so it made sense but I still recognise the sacrifice made). Both kids are now at school but I still have to be on top of everything and it is exhausting.\n\nThis week I have been leaving at 5am and getting home at around 8:30pm (except one day where I got home at 1am due to some bad traffic). When I get in I do bedtime with the kids and if the 4 year old wakes up in the night (which she usually does at least once) then I get up with her as he doesn’t hear her. (Giving this info for context).\n\nLast night he said he’d put a Christmas gift away he said it like he was currently doing it so I didn’t give it a second thought but for whatever reason he didn’t and this morning our daughter saw it. Frustrating and I expressed disappointment as it was something on her list so spoilt the Christmas magic a bit but who hasn’t gotten distracted on the way to do something. \n\nNext I reminded him it was her Christmas show. He’d already got it wrong earlier in the week despite a text message from me reminding him exactly what was needed. (He gets all the same information as I do from the school but doesn’t seem to log it, mentally or otherwise). He brought down the wrong outfit (it was a Christmas T-shirt and jeans which she wouldn’t have been allowed to wear) and said she didn’t have anything else. I went to look she did have other things but the outfit I knew she wanted to wear wasn’t put away or in the laundry. I told him I noticed he’d washed it yesterday and asked if he remembered what he’d done with it. He didn’t. This seemed to anger him but I eventually found the outfit he’d put it somewhere it wouldn’t usually go.\n\nNext her Christmas jumper was wet in the laundry and I couldn’t get it dry in the next 20 mins so that had to be skipped. \n\nFinally her Christmas antlers she’d chosen had been tidied away and he couldn’t remember what he’d done with them.\n\nBy this time I was just feed up. He was angrily following me around telling me I couldn’t do anything for myself (because I was asking where the things he’d put away literally yesterday were). Please bear in mind I found ever item myself, he maintained he couldn’t remember what he’d done with any of them but seemed to hate that I was asking him about it. \n\nBy this time I was late setting off, they were late for school and I was beyond fed up. Needless to say we ended up arguing with me asking why this wasn’t all sorted and why I was having to remind him of the laundry loads he’s done. I already do all the mental load but having to be his working memory as well was too much. Him saying it was just a dress and didn’t matter (it doesn’t to him, they frequently don’t have the things they need for school despite me sending morning reminders when I’m travelling). He continued that I was overreacting and that the only crime he’d committed was washing her clothes for her. \n\nTL/DR - husband stays home with the kids but isn’t on top of the school schedule, often leaving the kids without what they need and acts like I am high maintenance for expecting them to have what they need. \n\nAIO?",

    "text": "AIO for thinking my mom is infantilizing me? I just got off the phone with my mom feeling very frustrated and I wasn’t sure why. For context, I am a 23 year old woman living in my own place, financially independent, with a fiancée. The only thing that she can technically “hold” over me is that she put a down payment on my new car as a gift. \nSo I call my mom telling her about a concert I’m going to(my first concert too!). She asks me who I’m going with and I tell her a friend that she’s heard a bit about. Then she says, “I hope you didn’t pay for her ticket.” This was my mistake but when her tone gets like that, my people pleasing defense mechanism(that was built Because of hearing that tone all my life and getting punished for it) activated, and I said I didn’t to keep the peace. I didn’t want her to kick up a fuss about a $20 ticket that I bought with my own money. My mistake. Anyway, she continues to say that she doesn’t think I should be friends with someone “dumb and irresponsible” like my friend and that she doesn’t like me hanging out with her. My friend is also an adult and her crime in my mom’s eyes is having unprotected sex with her fiancé before marriage. She goes back to trying to convince me not to go. I understand that to some degree, since the concert will be held at night and there’s a possibility that I might end up going alone, but I want to go! I’ve been really excited for it and I thought this would be a great reward after killing it on my final exams at school. A light phone call about me telling her about a concert I was excited to go to turned into her basically berating me. Am I overreacting for thinking that my mom is still treating me like a child?",

    "text": "AIO for being more upset about my girlfriend going through my phone than what she found I woke up to my girlfriend admitting she went through my phone while I was asleep. No warning, no conversation just went through it on her own. She found old texts with my ex from about six months ago from before we were exclusive and now she’s demanding explanations like I did something wrong.\n\nThe thing is I’m not even that defensive about the texts themselves. They were from a time when I was single and nothing in them crossed a line. What’s bothering me way more is the fact that she went through my phone while I was unconscious. That feels like a serious violation of privacy.\n\nNow the whole situation feels flipped. Instead of talking about why she felt it was okay to secretly go through my phone I’m being interrogated over something that happened before our relationship was defined.\n\nI was sitting on my balcony earlier trying to figure out if I’m being too sensitive but I can’t shake how uncomfortable this feels. The trust feels damaged and I’m not even the one who crossed the boundary first.\n\nAm I overreacting for being upset about this or is this actually a big deal?",

    "text": "AIO for thinking my friends don’t actually want to be friends after cancelling a hangout? I (20F) am in a 3 person friend group, and we have a hangout scheduled for later today. It’s at my apartment, and I already bought extra food and the supplies for the craft night we were planning. It’s also the only time we are all available until January, because we’re in university together and in that weird gap between finals and the holidays.\n\nAbout an hour ago, one of the people said that he has a sore throat and can’t make it. For the record, he’s cancelled before for other reasons, and I’m not calling this excuse fake but I’m still a little suspicious. \n\nI texted back with the usual “oh no, hope you feel better!!” but then texted the other person and asked if she still wanted to come over. She said that I was being rude for wanting to exclude the other guy. The problem is, I haven’t seen them in about a month (still daily texting, just no in person hangouts even though each of us live literally 5 min away by walking) because he keeps cancelling. \n\nI asked if she would be willing if I asked if it was alright, and she just repeated that it would be rude to exclude him, but to ask anyways. I then texted him and asked if he would mind, and he said “of course not” and to bring him some cookies (we were planning on making them together!). She hasn’t responded to that yet, and we’re currently 30 min away from the time we were planning to meet up. \n\nIs it actually rude to keep the plans if someone cancels?? Or do they just not want to hang out with me? Am I overreacting for thinking that they don’t like me?",

    "text": "AIO my roommate has her fiancé practically living with us This has been something my roommate (Anna, 24F ) and I (23F) have been wanting to talk about with Gabby (24F). She started seeing this guy a few months back, and they’re pretty serious. We all moved in together a couple of months ago, but slowly her now fiancé “Mark” has been over more and more. They got engaged over a month ago. He’ll stay a bit in the morning when Gabby leaves for work and then come back in the evening when she comes back.\n\nHe tends to be over 4-5 days a week, and some of those days he sleeps over. We pay for gas and electric, so Anna and I had a plan to go over utilities and how they’re split. I got a notification on my xfinity app for 6 different websites trigging a security warning from his devices. I texted Anna, and sure enough, he’d been at the apartment all day without Gabby. The next day I was heading back to the apartment from being out of state for 2.5 weeks and the same thing. So I texted before she got back from work to see what’s going on and to express my concerns. \n\nAfter this text exchange she came back, and we all talked. Anna started the convo but Gabby started raising her voice and saying “I’m allowed whoever whenever I live here it’s also my lease.” She was also trying to say he was only over 2 days this week, which wasn’t true. The lease does clarify the only other occupants allowed are spouses of the tenant and children. Everyone else is considered a temporary visitor who is not entitled to the same lease rights. \n\nWe came to a “reasonable” conclusion: he can only stay until noon by the latest if he sleeps over on a work night, and Gabby has to chip in more for utilities to cover him. And he is allowed over 3 nights. I just found this whole thing wild; we didn’t sign up for 4 people living here we signed up for 3. We are going to monitor how often he is over now. AIO?",

    "text": "AIO-My cousin (40sM) wants to visit me abroad and meet my friends (35F), but he has a long history of using and hurting women — including my own friends. My family says I’m “immature” for refusing. Am I wrong? I (35F) moved to Thailand recently, and my cousin (40sM) now wants to visit me, have me show him around, and meet my friends. Given his history, I told him no — and now my family is calling me immature and saying I should “grow up.” I need some outside perspective.\n\nMy cousin has a long, well-known pattern of treating women terribly. For decades, he’s done the same cycle:\n\n* pursue a woman intensely\n* pretend he’s in love\n* sleep with her for a few months\n* disappear\n* deny paternity if she gets pregnant until forced by court\n* get arrested for domestic violence\n* claim he loves her again\n* get her to bail him out\n* then leave for the next woman\n\nThis behavior started in his teens/20s and has continued into his 40s with no change.\n\nThe part that affects me personally: he specifically targets *my* friends. He has told me outright that he does it “because it’s fun.” He doesn’t do this with other cousins’ friends — only mine.\n\nHe has slept with several of my friends from back home, including:\n\n* my high school friend, who had a baby with him and was dumped a few months postpartum; he denied the child until court-ordered\n* another friend (also my bishop’s granddaughter), whom he publicly humiliated by bragging to the entire town\n\nHe would make comments in front of me like, “Better watch out, I might get another one,” or ask if my friends were single. Every time, I warned my friends about him and emphasized I didn’t want to be involved. Some ignored me, dated him secretly, and later came crying when everything blew up. I ended several friendships because of this pattern.\n\nMy family has always brushed it off. They say I shouldn’t “police” his love life, or that I’m overreacting. At one point they even accused me of being jealous. (For the record: absolutely not. Even if we weren’t related, I wouldn’t go near someone who treats women like that.)\n\nNow that I live abroad, he wants to come to Thailand and “meet my friends.” I told him no — I don’t want a repeat of losing friendships, dealing with drama, or watching him hurt more women.\n\nHe ran to the family about it, and now they’re telling me I’m immature, that his behavior is in the past, and that I need to “grow up” and host him. But the last time I was back home (just a year ago), he was still in and out of jail for domestic violence. Nothing has changed.\n\nI feel like I’m being pressured to put my own life and relationships at risk for someone who has never taken responsibility for anything. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to protect my friends — and myself — from someone with a proven decades-long pattern.\n\n**Would I be wrong for refusing to let him visit or meet my friends?**\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nMy cousin has a decades-long pattern of manipulating women, refusing to take responsibility for his children, and getting arrested for domestic violence — including hurting several of my past friends. He specifically targets *my* friends “because it’s fun.” Now he wants to visit me in Thailand and meet my new friends, and my family says I’m “immature” for saying no. I don’t want more drama or destroyed friendships. Am I wrong to refuse?",

    "text": "AIO MY(24M) GF(24F) KINDA CHEATED ON ME MONTHS AGO BUT NOT REALLY ? Hi, im a 24 year old male and in a relationship with my gf. We had some problem which i used a translate app to explain here so that there are no misunderstandings and i can get all the help and advices from you people. I dont think its forbidden in this community but if it is know that it is definitely real, my words, just translated from another language.\n\n  \nWe broke up three months ago, and it was a pretty messy breakup. About a month before we split, she had started talking to another guy. He messaged her on Instagram, and when I saw it, I warned her. I told her he clearly wasn’t trying to be “just friends,” but she didn’t believe me and even got upset with me. Later on, I messaged the guy myself and told him to back off.\n\nThen for about two weeks, while she was still with me, she kept meeting up with him. There wasn’t anything physical or emotional going on (according to her), but they did go out together. She even travelled to his hometown to meet him, drove around with him in his car, talked for hours, etc.\n\nOne night, while we were still together, she told me she was going to visit a female friend. Then she turned off her phone and stayed unreachable until around 11 PM. Later she admitted she had been sitting in a park with that guy the whole time. She told me all of this herself. She said she regretted it and that she only did it because our relationship had been going really badly at the time. She promised she would never do anything like that again as long as we were doing well.\n\nBut honestly… it still feels like a huge betrayal. And the worst part is that whatever was happening between them only ended because *he* stopped showing interest. If he hadn’t backed off, she probably would’ve ended up with him, and we would’ve never gotten back together. (We were broken up for 2 months and then reconciled.)\n\nThat night when she turned off her phone, I completely broke down. I had a panic attack, my friends had to help calm me down for hours. When she finally turned her phone back on and I confronted her yelled at her, she acted like I had no right to be upset. Even months later, when the topic came up, she tried to make me feel guilty about it—saying things like, “You hurt me so much by yelling at me. I felt horrible,” without acknowledging what she had been doing.I didnt know about the other guy at the time.\n\nOnce she even told me that there are no secrets between us and i know everything about her and what she's been doing since the breakup. There obviously were some secrets though.\n\nWhen she finally admitted everything and I connected all the pieces, it crushed me. Something in me just… broke. I developed this constant feeling of distrust. She’s been trying really hard to fix things and rebuild what she damaged, but I still feel awful throughout the day. If I don’t hear from her for even a minute, my mind immediately jumps to “Is she with someone else?” or “Is she pulling away from me?”\n\nRight now she’s abroad and can only reach me when she finds Wi-Fi—so every 2–3 hours. She tries to update me and reassure me, but I’m constantly stressed and anxious. It’s exhausting. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if what happened is actually serious.\n\nSo now im always anxious and always questioning her, where is he, what is she doing etc. She's trying to help but sometimes snaps at me.\n\n\n\nFor context, we’ve been together for 3 years: 1.5 years in the same city, 1.5 years long-distance but meeting every month. We’re even planning to get married next year and had already started preparing for it. But this whole situation resurfaced and completely shattered my trust. The fact that she hid all of this from me for so long makes it so hard to believe her now.",

He has also told me that she has a reputation for sleeping around the camp.\n\nHe then comes home a few weeks ago, and said he’s up for a promotion for good performance at work. Coincidentally, the day this came out, Brittany wants to sit with him at meal time and make friendly with him. He goes on to say “she isn’t that bad”.\n\nI told him that all of that is fucking weird. It’s weird that he went from saying she’s a bitch to being friendly, and it’s weird that she’s suddenly nice to him since he’s getting promoted. He thinks I’m crazy for thinking that and that nobody else would find this weird. So, am I overreacting?",

Anyways last week her mom brought her here and she didn’t have the pay which I didn’t think much of because sometimes she brings it after she picks her up, but she came her and said she “forgot it” like how do you forget that lol, anyways that irritated me cause I took care of her kid for over 9 hours and she was being really wild that day and getting into lots of trouble, but she paid me back the week after with $10 extra, and she just brought her again and she didn’t have the pay ONCE AGAIN, she told me a while after she dropped her off that she couldn’t bring the pay later on, I’m pissed off now I have to watch her kid for hours for absolutely nothing to be earned from it, like I’m not babysitting for fun or for charity, I’m just irritated and feel like I can’t deal with this again honestly.",

A video of a naked women in his messages that he saved in chat. Now before I do anything drastic, I need to know if it'll be overreacting if I leave him. Biggest issue currently is he just went thru some major health issues and his mind isn't quite right anymore so I feel bad leaving him. His vision is mostly gone so a job is difficult and disability has been a process to say the least. I'm very upset tho. AIO if I leave? If I leave he'll be homeless.",

Later I heard from my mom that she’s upset and thinks I dont want her around.\n\nNow Im sitting here feeling guilty because I didnt mean it that way at all.

HOWEVER, i told my dad about this production and he was the one that signed the audition form letting me… well… audition for the show.\n\nflash forward to thanksgiving, i bring up at the table that im playing a lead in pliant girls. my parents look really confused at each other and then back at me, and my dad says AND I QUOTE: ”…wait… you’re in another show?” i was a bit heartbroken and i look at my mom and she shrugs as well. my dad has in the past shrugged off my theatre accomplishments (i.e. after a really bad callback and when i was on the verge of tears he said “well at least you’ll get something.”) and so this hurt. tonight as well, i asked him if any of my extended family was seeing the show, to which he AGAIN looked bewildered and asked “whats pliant girls?..” to which i had to explain everything.\n\nthe reason im asking this is bc i KNOW it’s partly my fault they forgot, i kept it on the DL and my rehearsals are during school. however, this still hurts especially since my dad claims he is very involved in all aspects of my life (mostly work bc i don’t have a license and theatre.) am i overreacting? is this truly not a big deal?\n\nedit: thank you all so much for the comments, advice, and feedback, it means a lot to me. to clear some things up\n\n1: my dad does not have problems with his memory yet.\n\n2: i do already have a therapist and i will be talking with her about this too, ty for the suggestions\n\n3: no the play is not over and no i didn’t intentionally hide it from him, like him it slipped my mind because of the show i was already in.\n\n4: i will be putting all my stuff on the calendar, ty for the suggestion :)\n\n5: me and my dad both have horrendous social cue skills (we’re both autistic) so naturally miscommunications like this happen. i’m not saying this as an “i have autism card” im just pointing this out bc i left out crucial context.\n\n6: i probably will take this post down, so thank you for all the comments and not being rude to me, i’m just scared of people being genuinely rude or mean about the whole situation (and also the notifications) thank you so much again for all the advice i will keep this in mind :) as always, stay safe spread love and rock on 💜",

Also what he’s mentioning is, he hit me up earlier this week for a date and then doing “cardio in bed” afterwards. I asked if he’s been sexually active bc he told me he flew out to see an ex, and he said yes. He asked if that’ll be an issue I said mentally no but physically probably. We left it at that until I text him today asking this. Sure sex was brought up until he mentioned he doesn’t use condoms 🥴 \n\nI figured us getting to know each other for 2 months without sex was enough grounds to at least just stay platonic friends but I guess not. Men truly find ways to reveal their true nature.",

    "text": "AIO for not getting a birthday gift of my choice? so hear me out everyone… \n\nI’m in a relationship with this person who is doing financially ok (and makes more than me). This will come in to play later in story. \n\nWe’ve been together for a while and normally we do typical things when it comes to birthday such as gifts and cake. normally the gifts have been nice (from my perspective). It could be things like nice lotions or maybe a new kitchen appliance. A lot of my gift request also tend to be things that we could share like a water filter.\n\nIn recent years, we normally have an Amazon wish list where we can just pick things. But this year was a little bit difficult. my birthday comes first in the calendar, and I remember having a variety of items on my list, including socks and underwear. The most expensive thing was probably the mini AI pet.\n\nI got a comment from my partner, which was that putting socks and underwear on my wish list wasn’t cool because those aren’t considered real gifts. Even though I would appreciate them. \n\nfast-forward, on the day of my birthday, my partner tells me that I will get a gift late this year, which is fine with me. Eventually, I was presented with a storage cart. It’s one of those things you build yourself and you can put stuff on it and you can wheel it around. Apparently that was my gift. And yes, I definitely was spoiled at this point even though I actually did like the item. And then the second item was a bedframe for my mattress (which I really didn’t need). I was a little bit letdown. And maybe I am really unappreciative \n\nI got a lecture afterwards saying that I should just appreciate what I got. Part of me feels a little hurt because I know this person will spend more money on their own family’s bday than mine. But also, this person has been lecturing me a lot more about how I live my life. \n\nA month later comes my partner’s birthday. I know this person did not update their wishlist, so I asked them what they wanted. I was told macbook, ipad, smart ring, remarkable pro… stuff that can go 1.2k and up…. \n\nAnd when I made a comment about how these are all luxury items… the response I got was “ Don’t worry about it then, I’ll get it myself someday.”\n\n that response hurt me deep. And I can’t forget it… this person makes a significant amount more than me, and they’ve been known to throw money away on things that don’t always make sense… whereas I’m the kind of person that has to count every dollar to make sure I can pay all the bills.. \n\nAt this point, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting … am I reading too much into the statement? what should i do? i can probably afford something from the list, but part of me feels sad that my partner didn’t want to treat me to something off my list… birthdays come once a year and i honestly feel i won’t have many more due to my health (separate story on that). :(",

    "text": "AIO think I'm married to a narcissist. Married for 4 years together almost 10. Have one biological hyperactive adhd boy (5) who I swear is on the spectrum (being tested for) and my son he chose to accept back at the age of 2 1/2. Now 12 . He has shown many, many signs of being a selfish narc. But didn't show them till our child we had together was about 2yo. He claimed his job stressed him out. So we moved across the US for a new job. That's when things FELL apart. \n\nHis anger he claims he over came, came out like a thousand hot daggers. The way he treats not only me, but our youngest and eldest is just. Toxic. He gets angry red hot over the smallest things. He's never \"hit\" anyone. But threatens spanking  the kids and will yank the youngest by his arm for timeouts, over the littlest thing. Which is yelling in his face at top notch with his loud booming voice and if im being real. I think there have been times he has slapped him on his bottom due to anger. Under circumstances, our fights have led to him belittling me, calling me names little B****. I told him are not acceptable as I never call him a jerk AH our D bag. Even when acting like one. He degrades the kids calling them dumb, stupid and spoiled. When they aren't. \n\n He thinks working all day at a salary job with a degree he chose, is so much that 5 minutes at home, while me being tapped out from handling everything else, is TOO MUCH.  He gets to play video games, leave to hang out with friends or a work function a drop of the dime. I never get out or even have friends. Because I'm a SAHM until our youngest is capable of going to school with occupational therapy to help him succeed. Even then I don't see me getting me time, ever in the future. He complains at my vices, when he was ready to quit the Same things, because he is ready. But I couldn't handle quitting them, if he did, because he was miserable to deal with and the kids. \n\nI'm the family mediator, care taker, makes all appointments unless it's his car or his health. He just doesn't seem to have wanted a family just the idea of it. And honestly wishing he just left me alone as a single mom back then doing my thing and succeeding. Now I'm states away from support and wondering what do I do. Thought I could suck it up and he would grow up. But he has only gotten worse. Many times I've thought about starting the back up plan to be supporting me and these boys so he can finally have his dream. A lazy bachelor doing whatever he wants but he always snaps to bread crumbs of small apologies and change, that he really didn't mean it. Am I over reacting or am I in a traumatic response? I'm asking because I don't have a ton of family who is mentally aware or would ever tell me what they think. I need a third out side party to see if this is red flag or am I just an iverwhekmed exhausted mom. \n\nSorry for typos/ grammer and ranting. I'm typing from phone and new to reddit. And I'm also at my millionth time of giving up and exhaustion. It's hitting the hardest as holidays are around the corner and this is a holiday meant to be about family and being thankful to have it. But things without detail are really crashing around from kiddos health to mine plus house issues in winter are piling up. \n\nPlease any opinions on my spewing out the littlest details would help. But if not I guess it feels good to get off my chest somewhere. \n\nEdit to add I'm very happy being a mom to these boys I chose to have. Even though it does get very overwhelming and stressful. I would never say I regret it or poor me. Just wish maybe the partner I thought I married turned out to be the man every devoted mother and wife end up with. I guess I'm seeing the mask slip, and I wonder, am I overreacting from past trauma, or does everyone else maybe outside of the world see little red flags, too?",

    "text": "AIO for telling the rep I support that he needs to split weekend coverage with me? I (F) work for a large medical device sales company. It’s just me and one primary rep covering our territory.\n\nRecently, it’s been treated as a given that I will cover every single weekend case if we have one (they are unpredictable and only happen in emergent cases / when our docs are on call). I brought up that I think we should split weekends instead of it always falling on me.\n\nHe’s technically my superior, but we’re both adults with full lives outside of work. Being an associate doesn’t mean my time is less valuable or that I’m an unlimited resource. He then told me that if I were a full rep as well, he would split weekends with me — but since I’m an associate, it “makes sense” that I take them.\n\nI honestly think that’s unfair. I’m still providing the same level of support in cases, the same availability, and the same workload during the week. The territory doesn’t function without both of us, and I don’t think hierarchy = automatic weekend dumping.\n\nI told him that expecting me to cover every weekend feels outdated and that I’m not willing to be taken advantage of. I’m not asking to opt out of weekends entirely — just for a reasonable, sustainable split.\n\nSo… AIO for pushing back and saying weekend coverage should be shared instead of me being the default person every time?",

    "text": "AIO Friend claims she’s responsible for my relationship Me and my boyfriend met in February at University and started hanging out nearly 4-5 times a week until May. At the time it was nothing serious and we both told eachother we didn’t want a relationship, as we both knew the semester was ending soon and that we would both have to go back to our home states which are across the country. \n\nOnce the semester ended, we stayed in touch all throughout the summer. We were both  hooking up with other people, but we would still call and text a lot to catch up. As soon as the new semester started, the absolute first night he moved in he asked me to sleepover because he wanted to see me so bad. I slept over and all was well and we continued to hang out daily since we were both back and happy to be with each other. We were still not exclusive and just in a talking stage for a while, and eventually I introduced him to some of my good friends that i had met in August. \n\nWe all got along super well at first and would hang out nightly in our dorms. My friends noticed how close me and this guy were and how we would act like a couple and they fully supported it and wanted us to actually be officially together. They would do some silly things like ask him how he felt about me or if he wanted to be with me, and it got us pretty much nowhere because he would just say he liked me but wasn’t ready for a relationship (which i already knew). We all continued hanging out in a group and eventually took a trip together. Over this trip, things developed and me and him started getting a lot closer. He started sleeping over every night, and we eventually started dating and fell in love rather quickly. \n\nNow, back to my friends. They’ve been kind of weird this whole relationship. We’re young so this next part may sound juvenile but somethings i noticed was one of my friends added him on snapchat and asked him to add her back (he reluctantly did because we were all friends). She asked me if her snapping him would make me uncomfortable and I told her honestly that it would bug me a bit if they consistently snap chatted every day, so she promised she wouldn’t and said she understood. Flash forward a few weeks later, she has a streak with him and is sending him videos of her and her friend rubbing their feet together in foot masks? It was so bizarre they didn’t send that video to me, just him, and brought it up infront of me. He agrees this was weird and stopped snapping them because that was just icky. Something else to keep in mind is that when we all hung out, I used to sit next to him on one of our beds, but then before we started dating we were not allowed to sit together because my friends freak out and get uncomfortable and kind of throw digs at us.  \n\nThis friend is now claiming that she’s the reason we’re happily together and says it’s “genuinely because of her that we’re together and dating” but in my view, while she may have helped us get together through just agreeing to group hangouts or maybe doing some setups (i can’t even think of any right now), but barely considering we weren’t even allowed to sit next to eachother (still aren’t even though we’re dating). Another thing is, we’ve been talking since february, before we even MET that girl, so how is it fully her doing. It just really rubs me the wrong way and I want to call her out but is that rude? Am I overreacting about this?",

He said yes. Last week the professor reminded me that the term for us is in the few weeks. The guy I’m supposed to work with isn’t very actively attending the lectures. I messaged him (for the first time) asking if he remembers abt it and that I can do it myself for us both during the christmas weekend. He didn’t respond so I sent him a friend request too. \nAt the same time he was chatting on group chat so he must’ve seen the notifications. \n\nAt first I thought he’ll respond later but after a few days of no reply from him, I realised he’s just being sassy because of our little argument 2 months ago. He has a thing for touching girls without consent. 2 months ago I snapped at him in public after he grabbed me by my arm (again) while talking, it wasn’t the first time he just looked for a reason to do so. Since then we didn’t talked like, at all, but I didn’t care abt it too because we don’t have to be friends. \n\n(side note: he’s still touching other girls A LOT and they’re all pretty much upset but they’re also younger than me and lack the back bone to tell him something. he touches their faces or necks, grabs by the arms from behind etc. he’s a creep.)\n\nToday I wanted to ask him directly why isn’t he replying because it’s just the work we have to do and that if he’s so upset then we can work separately on different subjects. I just wanted it done. But the first thing he did after coming to our group on the hallway was shaking hands with everyone BUT me, instead he grabbed my head from behind and stroked it aggressively, without saying anything. \nI gasped, turned around and called him out, saying he has no right to touch me and he knows that because I already told him once. He just walked away smirking without saying anything. \n\nWe’re both close age - late first year students - and I’ve already dealt with shit like that in my previous workplaces. \nRight after coming home I emailed the professor asking that due to no contact with the other student from my group, I want to be assigned to other theme for the project that I’d like to do alone. \nI didn’t told/text him anything, but now I’m wondering if I won’t come off as overreacting when she informs him about that. I guess she will tell him that he’s working alone or ask why sooner or later. \nAIO?",

    "text": "AIO for feeling burnt out of my friendship? So I’ve (24F) had this friend since high school (25F) and she’s always kinda been a me me me girl, always talking about herself, her problems whatever and like I was fine with it cause I mean I kinda just went with the flow back in high school and I’m not generally too much of a yapper. But we went to different colleges and stopped hanging out as much (which again is fine.) But I started to feel like every time I went back to the city and asked her if she wanted to hang out and made plans (which she agreed to) she’d always back out and say “oh well my boyfriend is doing this so I’m going to hang out with him and his friends” or “my boyfriend can’t give me a ride so I can’t go” and would always follow up by saying “oh but we’re going to be here so you can hang out with us instead if you want” \n\nBro when I tell you I HATE hanging out with her boyfriend and his friends. Why? Cause this man is 40 fkn years old. A grown ass man and every time I’ve hung out with this grown ass man and his grown ass men friends they’d get the bright ass idea that bc she’s dating a grown ass man that I would want to too. \n\nFUUCK NO. \n\nALSO why the hell do you need a ride WHEN WE LIVE IN NYC, take the damn train. \n\nAnyways crashout aside I got fed up with it and just stopped inviting her to shit. So we haven’t spoken now in a couple months (maybe even longer I stopped keeping track) and out of the blue she calls me crying “hey how are you, it’s been so long, what’s new? We need to hang out.” And then proceeds to dump on me all the relationship issues they have been having for the past 5-6 years oh and did I mention this man has a whole ass kid, not half a child, a whole fucking child ANNND that he’s known her since we were at least in senior year of high school. Just a lil tid bit of information. I was always like whatever it’s not my business she’s always been the type to care about how “mature” she is and say shit to me like “oh you’re the only friend I have my age” like that was a flex? \n\nBut idk I got roped into scheduling a day during Christmas week to hang out with her since I’d be back in the city and my mom said “absolutely not. She’s not going to get in the way of my mother daughter time” and I that I need to stop picking up strays bc I’m too sympathetic to the problems of others 😅 which I mean yes but it’s just easier said than done to just drop somebody especially since I’ve known her for so long. \n\nIdk I feel like maybe just maybe I see a tiny sliver of the girl I was friends with that wasn’t attached to the hip of her mans but also I should probably just cut my losses and move on… idk I need help. Ofc it’s not my responsibility to play therapist and fix her life but also I just idk i feel like my friends are dropping like flies, i probably just need to make friend with more stable people but again easier said than done 😭",

    "text": "Woke up to my husband punching himself in the face? AIO?? Before anyone asks, yes this is a new account because I know how Redditors like to tussle. \n\nAnyway, my husband was on baby duty last night for our 7 month old. I’m a light sleeper so I usually wake up when the baby cries (his crib is in our room). I woke up once, my husband got up to give our son his pacifier. He goes back to bed, a few minutes later I wake up again only to see my husband punching himself in the face twice. I say “what the fuck??” And he’s like “what??” I ask him why he did that, and he’s like “the baby won’t go to sleep!!” \n\nI tell him I know he’s only gotten up once before this, ask him if he gave the baby his night bottle or changed him (he didn’t do either) and ask again why he did that. He scoffed and got up to do his actual night duties of changing/feeding him. \n\nWhen we got up this morning reiterated that I was very uncomfortable with how he reacted last night at the baby fussing, and that it’s the same thing every night, so idk why he reacted that way. I’m still a little bothered by what happened even though my husband is acting “normal” now. We’re going on vacation tomorrow so I really don’t want to start a huge fight about it but I’m still upset.

    "text": "AIO for taking offense on this “vlogger” who wore a camera on his specs during event So I attended an intimate make-your-own menthol inhaler workshop few weeks ago and I saw a vlog about that event. I saw my face and my friends’ faces on the vlog, but I cannot figure out who shot the videos. It was a very small event, I think we were just six people who attended the event. \n\nWhen I scrolled through my gallery, I figured out that it was that one guy who was wearing specs with built in camera. \n\nAIO for being mad? First, he didnt ask for permission to take videos of us, let alone post us on his social media without blurring our faces. Second, we had no idea he was recording, and my friends and I were talking about some topics not meant to be heard by people outside the group. Though there was no audio on his vlog, but still, he recorded the whole workshop. Is that an ethical vlogging practice?",

    "text": "AIO about my bf not messaging me back? I (18f) my bf (19m) have been together for 3 years, and we are a long distance relationship. His daily schedule isn’t very busy, he goes to school, comes back home, naps, does household chores, and makes dinner every now and then. Today was different than others. There has been a handful of times he hasn’t texted back for a long while because he was busy shopping or napping, but today was definitely different. I haven’t gotten a single text today at all, nothing. I’ve been on delivered all day, tried to call him, no response. He’s been inactive on everything and his location hasn’t updated in almost 24 hours. Should I be concerned or AIO?\n\n**Update #1**: Its been less than a few hours since this post I’ve made and his location has turned off, I no longer can see the last time he’s been online.\n\n**Update #2**: it’s been 11-12 hours since this post and I can reassure that he is okay and not hurt.\n\nHe woke up and completely forgot the password to his phone. He found his laptop and tried to sign into snapchat, but it wouldn’t let him. His phone is now locked up for 3 days, so he sent it with his cousin so she could reset it and she'll be back tomorrow. (today) He said “I hope she fixes it because I was so scared and upset like ive seriously been thinking how ima get in contact with you. And then I remember TikTok and I signed in on here”",

    "text": "AIO: My gf won't let me have a female trainer I’ve been w my girlfriend on and off for 8 years. I recently found a new trainer after a friend recommended one that he uses, and she just so happens to be a woman. Before my first session I mentioned this to my girlfriend, and told her that I was going to work out with this friend of mine and give the trainer a try; she was supportive and had no concerns. Fast forward to my third session, my friend is out of town, and a couple of other guys in our group either worked out earlier or cancelled, leaving me to workout alone with the trainer. The sessions are in a fitness center and there are usually other people there as well, but the trainer and me would be off to the side for a more guided workout. I told my girlfriend this but because she doesn’t trust  other girls, especially “women around men\" and she thought all sessions would be w my friend or others, she was against it. She said just because the first couple of sessions were ok, doesn’t mean this girl isn't attracted to me and possibly try something.\n\nShe made it clear that she trusts me, but she does not want me “alone” with this girl. I mentioned the other ppl being near us in the same facility but she doesn’t care. I told her I didn’t agree with her mindset and that it was childish. She says this is a very logical and normal way for women to think, that most women would agree with her, and that I can just workout alone or see the trainer when my friend is there. I told my girlfriend having a trainer was important because I’m just not as committed or disciplined when working out by myself. Having someone I have to be accountable to, and that I’m spending money on, gives me encouragement to stick with it. We argued and she said I was choosing another woman over our relationship. I’m stuck, and finding it difficult to be with someone who believes that all women have an ulterior motive, and that there can be no productive platonic interactions with women. AIO for wanting to end this?",

    "text": "AIO for considering leaving? I don’t feel attractive to my husband and am mentally checked out. TL;DR: My husband and I recently got married, but I feel unwanted, unseen, and like an option to him. Our past open relationship left me feeling sidelined, and since pregnancy/postpartum he rarely initiates sex, rarely compliments me, and openly admires other women. A recent Friendsgiving incident — where he ignored me, flirted with my friend, made sexual jokes about her, and didn’t help when my blood sugar dropped — broke my trust even more. Now his “effort” feels forced. I’m in therapy and don’t know if this marriage is fixable or if I should leave. Looking for advice.\n\nMy husband (M28) and I (F23) have been together 4 years and recently got married. He was previously married (freshly 18 in the military, iykyk), and it ended in divorce (divorce settled 1 yr into relationship but was separated the whole time). The divorce devastated him — he said he was beyond depressed after they separated and originally didn’t believe he’d love again. He now tells me I’m the love of his life, but lately I don’t feel that way.\n\nFor backstory we got together quickly, moved in fast, and early in the relationship he became incapacitated. I stayed and took care of him for 2.5 years. Eventually we moved in with his mom and things got better between us. We even explored an open relationship with other women. Eventually we had a consistent girlfriend, but that situation ended up hurting me deeply.\n\nDuring the throuple, he started prioritizing her in ways that cut me down emotionally. During sex he focused mostly on her. I’d literally sit on the sidelines using toys (that i specifically bought just so wasnt left neglected and watching) because I felt like a spectator, not a partner or active participant. At night he’d cuddle her and turn his back to me. Our girlfriend started coming over less often and we started having sex just us again but it felt like it was because I was the only option now. I felt invisible in my own relationship, and when I started to withdraw emotionally, he didn’t seem to care until I was nearly checked out.\n\nThings only stopped when she ghosted us and shortly after, I found out I was pregnant in June 2024. After that, sex between us dropped even more. I know pregnancy changes things, but even after giving birth, nothing improved. I’d initiate and get rejected. When I was finally ready to be intimate postpartum, he told me “no” because he wanted to get drunk with our friend M26. He said our friend was going through a tough time and being there for him through his breakup was more important. He then added “no offense and hope that’s ok” to soften the blow.\n\nOutside of sex, I also don’t feel beautiful or wanted. He rarely compliments me, but he freely points out what he finds attractive about random women we see. He makes a lot of fat jokes about strangers, and even though he’s never insulted me directly, it makes me wonder what he thinks of me — especially since I gained weight during pregnancy. I’m trying to lose weight now, but his support feels passive at best.\n\nOne of the most recent incidents really broke something in me: I hosted a Friendsgiving that I spent days preparing for. He didn’t help me cook until I was damn near done — I had to have friends come early and bring dishes just to pull it off. He rushed me to finish even though he only helped out at the very end.\n\nBecause I had been cooking all day and hadn’t eaten, my blood sugar started dropping. Before my blood sugar even dropped, he spent the night complimenting my friend (F23) on how good she looked. We ended poly stuff back in 2024, but he hinted multiple times about wanting to have sex with her. He even joked that if he couldn’t have a threesome with her, he’d settle for watching her and me have sex “as long as he could film it.” He claimed it was a joke, but it didn’t feel like one — it felt inappropriate.\n\nLater that night, my blood sugar dropped and I told him I needed help. He didn’t really care (he claims he just didn’t hear my pleas for help). He kept talking to her, trying to get her drunk, and giving her relationship advice. When I asked for a drink because I was nodding off, he brought me one I couldn’t even open… and didn’t help me open it. Then he spent the next hour talking to her while I lay there feeling ignored, embarrassed, and honestly a little scared.\n\nAfter I brought this up, he told me he “didn’t realize he could actually lose me” and that he was “just being stupid.”\n\nEver since, he has been trying more — complimenting me more, having sex more — but it all feels forced and reactive. Not real. Not because he wants me, but because he wants to avoid losing me.\n\nHonestly, I feel like an option. Like the safe, loyal one he comes home to, but not someone he actually desires. I feel like the warm body he settles for while he idolizes other women. I feel like he only shows care when I’m at the breaking point.\n\nI’ve been in therapy for my mental health. I’m wondering if I should bring all of this to my therapist, or if we should try couples therapy. I’m also wondering if this relationship is salvageable, or if the emotional wounds are too deep.\n\nI want to feel wanted, valued, and seen. But right now, I feel like a placeholder. Where do we go from here?\n\nETA: he is a great father and since I’ve been in school and not working (was a traveling bartender but full time student since May 2024 and SAHM all 2025) he’s been financially taking care of us. Part of me feels like it’s out of obligation/repaying me taking care of him. He’s not a big romantic gestures guy either so there’s that",

    "text": "AIO for snapping at my GF (26F) after she threw me under the bus to her mom for not helping her move? I (27M) need an outside perspective on this because I feel like I’m going crazy.\n\nContext: My girlfriend (26F) and I both started school around the same time. My program was online, hers was in-person, so her work hours got cut. We had an agreement that she’d keep paying her usual $700/month towards the mortgage.\n\nWell, after her second month of school, the payments just stopped. I tried to be understanding. I told her, \"Just let me know in advance what you can or can’t pay so I can budget for us.\" She never did. Instead, every time I brought it up, she’d get mad at me to shut down the conversation. It’s been a full year now, and she hasn’t paid a dime.\n\nThe frustrating part isn't even the rent itself, it’s that she hasn’t adjusted her lifestyle at all. While I’m paying for the mortgage, bills, food, and literally everything else, she’s still spending a crazy amount on Starbucks and running up my credit card on unnecessary stuff. She actually just graduated a month ago, and for Thanksgiving, she dropped hundreds of dollars so her family could have a \"great Thanksgiving.\" Meanwhile, I’ve been stressing to her constantly about how tight money is for me right now because I'm carrying both of us.\n\nShe recently took a travel nursing position all the way across the country. She wanted me to go out there to help her get settled in. I told her the truth: I literally don’t have the funds to make that trip because I’ve been drained paying for everything for the last year.\n\nShe got pissed. She immediately called her mom while I was standing right there and threw me under the bus. She said, “He told me he’s not helping me move in,” using this tone that made me sound like a completely unsupportive partner. She gave zero context on why I couldn't go (aka, I'm broke from supporting her).\n\nAfter she hung up, I snapped. I’m not proud of it, but it was my breaking point after a year of not being heard or understood. I raised my voice and let all that frustration out.\n\nAIO?\n\nEdit: There’s a lot of detail here and I know I probably missed some things since I'm writing this while frustrated, so let me know in the comments if I need to explain anything else.",

Even though I’ve grown up with dogs, mine never (to my knowledge) had that bad of amount of fleas. \n\nWhat unsettled me was he told me he had to have their house fumigated once due to the amount of fleas. I have very bad eczema and the bites have been causing me to itch more and more and my skin is the worst i’ve ever seen it.\n\nSince I don’t really know what to do, I was only young when I had dogs so I never had to flea them, I have flead her and vacuumed the whole house everyday like it said so on internet but I work too and I get very tired doing it. \n\nFor some reason, and I feel horrible, I can’t have her near me… on my lap or next to me since I’m paranoid of the fleas jumping onto me and my eczema, sounds stupid I know.\n\nMy boyfriend keeps going mental saying I’m abusing her and I’m a horrible person, I agree how I am now will confuse her and I still stroke her and kiss her but my partner doesn’t vacuum/flea her or wash anything… I do. No wonder the house had to get fumigated! \n\ni’ve asked everyone for tips to get rid of them but he refuses to take her to vet to get some advice. It’s HIS cat so I feel at a loss on what to do. \n\nAIO… and if so what can I do to help?",

    "text": "My childhood blanket. Almost 2 years ago I was in a hurry to leave and vacate my home due to a family emergency. I grabbed everything that I needed, but I also left a lot of my things behind. Including my childhood baby blanket. The pain I am feeling is something that could have easily been avoided. However that is not the case. I was given multiple chances to go back and get it, but I didn’t have a reliable way to get there. \n\nWith that being said, my blanket is gone. I have played with the idea of getting another one but I have searched google, I have looked all over the internet and I keep getting discouraged. \n\nI am unsure of the brand. There were no tags on it. The blanket was small, quilted. With blue squares with stripes, white squares with pink flowers, and underneath the blanket, there were kittens playing with balls of yarn. What made it so special was the holes in it from all of the years I’ve had it. And at the bottom of the blanket, there was random colorful threads which were my first stitched I ever done with my great grandmother. (Dearly departed.) The last sliver of information I have on this blanket is it was purchased in the year 1987. I am really unsure. If anyone has any information or if you can find this blanket I don’t know how I could repay you. It would fill such a huge hole in my heart.",

In this case, I can't just look in my 'saved' catelouge because it's been so long since I saved the video that I'd just be scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.\n\nAnyway, the artist has a popular reel to a Patrick Bateman, American Psycho, audio- the one where he says his mask of sanity is about to slip. They have an ongoing story with their OC(s) about a girl with white hair and her boyfriend.\n\nIn said story the boyfriend has a chip implanted into him and his body/conciousness keeps being taken over by the robotic chip changing his personality and it takes years for anyone to notice. The robot in the chip, who keeps taking over the boyfriend's body, eventually falls for the girlfriend-but she, upon finding out that it's not really her boyfriend, is disgusted by him and wants her real boyfriend back.\n\nI remember their both of their dads' had something going on with the goverment too. There's this one post where they tell their respective son and daughter: 'I hope you never live a life as eventful as mine'\n\nLastly, I know that there was another name given to the robot in the boyfriend upon finding out it wasn't really him--something like 'Gnat' or 'Nert'? I don't know. I think the artist was planning on realeasing a webcomic about them soorner or later...\n\nSooooo, thats's basically the highlights of what I remember-- if anyone figures it out or has a guess (no matter how unsure) please comment! This has been itching my brain for awhile now.\n\nThanks :)",

    "text": "Please help me find this niche Japanese flamenco song! A few years ago, I was recommended a song in YouTube music where all the text was in Japanese. I fell in love with it and added it to my playlist to listen to it; however years later, I remember how I loved this song and went to look for it, but all trace of it was gone in my playlist! Now, I only have vague memories of the video, but I distinctly remember the melody and tune quite well. It's been stuck in my head and I've loved it since I first heard it.\n\nHere's all I know: \n\n* The actual song is very Latin. Spanish guitar, possibly an accordion, claps, and rhythm. The 15-second intro begins very upbeat and fun, with what I think is an accordion and a guitar. Then it gets into the first verse.\n* The vocalist seems to be a Japanese woman. She has a very high voice.\n* If I remember correctly, there's the intro, the first verse, chorus, second verse, chorus, bridge/breakdown (most of the instruments pull back and she sings with just the accordion), then the final chorus (where all the instruments return). I don't know exactly where it fits in, but there *is* a Spanish guitar solo followed by a tiny verse a little before the breakdown.\n* The YouTube video was very unpolished; it seemed to be just a montage of flamenco dances and rose petals with PowerPoint transitions (lol).\n* However, the thumbnail is stuck in my head. It depicted the face of an anime girl with long, straight, dark hair, she was in a gothic dress, there was a blue filter on the whole image, but her eyes were red. She faces the front with her head tilted to her right. It only depicts her face and part of her neck. She takes up the right 2/3 of the thumbnail. I have watched many anime shows and I don't immediately recognize her from any series, so perhaps she's just a neat illustration.\n* The video itself, (last time I checked back in Fall 2023) had only about 30k views and 3 likes (one of them being me, haha). I believe there were no comments, and I didn't catch the date of it being posted.\n* Because the title was in Japanese, I once tried to translate it to see if I could look it up on my own (in case an event like this ever occurred!). I don't remember it exactly, but the title was something along the lines of \"The Princess and the Salamander\". Perhaps it was a Japanese to English translation of \"dragon\" or something.\n* The song is approximately 2-5 minutes long. I don't remember it being long, but I can't guarantee the actual length.\n\nIt's a very lovely song and it gets stuck in my head quite frequently, so it's a pain that I can't find it. Please help me find this niche Japanese flamenco song!",

    "text": "My childhood blanket. Almost 2 years ago I was in a hurry to leave and vacate my home due to a family emergency. I grabbed everything that I needed, but I also left a lot of my things behind. Including my childhood baby blanket. The pain I am feeling is something that could have easily been avoided. However that is not the case. I was given multiple chances to go back and get it, but I didn’t have a reliable way to get there. \n\nWith that being said, my blanket is gone. I have played with the idea of getting another one but I have searched google, I have looked all over the internet and I keep getting discouraged. \n\nI am unsure of the brand. There were no tags on it. The blanket was small, quilted. With blue squares with stripes, white squares with pink flowers, and underneath the blanket, there were kittens playing with balls of yarn. What made it so special was the holes in it from all of the years I’ve had it. And at the bottom of the blanket, there was random colorful threads which were my first stitched I ever done with my great grandmother. (Dearly departed.) The last sliver of information I have on this blanket is it was purchased in the year 1987. I am really unsure. If anyone has any information or if you can find this blanket I don’t know how I could repay you. It would fill such a huge hole in my heart.",

I'm now starting to plan that event but can't find the account/event/flyer for reference material and could use some help locating it if someone out there has any idea.\n\nKey info:\n\n* The trivia was in New York City--probably Brooklyn but maybe Manhattan or Queens\n* The post was sometime in the last 3-6 months and the events are likely still happening or at least have been quite recently\n* The trivia host promoting the event was a woman in her 20s or 30s and I think maybe had red hair.\n* The flyers for all the trivia events were pretty elaborate collage style graphics. The specific flyer I looked at was for the hosts' birthday party trivia night.\n* I don't think the trivia was affiliated with one of the larger trivia brands that host pub quizzes in the city. It's possible it was but this one had a feel of more of a passion project, and what I can only describe as like a cooler/artsier vibe than your typically bar trivia. \n\nI know it's a long shot but have tried searching all these permutations of the key words I can come up with and no luck so far. Hope someone can help.\n\nCheers!",

I’ve searched stock sites and found many Barong clips, and one Getty image that matches the mask design, but I can’t find the exact video clip used. Anyone recognize a specific stock clip ID, vendor, or documentary that has this shot?Thank you! (I’ll share any leads.)",

    "text": "Help me find a NYC Trivia Event (instagram) Bit of a niche one but a while back my partner showed me an instagram account for a trivia event/host in NYC that they wanted to use as inspiration for their birthday party. I'm now starting to plan that event but can't find the account/event/flyer for reference material and could use some help locating it if someone out there has any idea.\n\nKey info:\n\n* The trivia was in New York City--probably Brooklyn but maybe Manhattan or Queens\n* The post was sometime in the last 3-6 months and the events are likely still happening or at least have been quite recently\n* The trivia host promoting the event was a woman in her 20s or 30s and I think maybe had red hair.\n* The flyers for all the trivia events were pretty elaborate collage style graphics. The specific flyer I looked at was for the hosts' birthday party trivia night.\n* I don't think the trivia was affiliated with one of the larger trivia brands that host pub quizzes in the city. It's possible it was but this one had a feel of more of a passion project, and what I can only describe as like a cooler/artsier vibe than your typically bar trivia. \n\nI know it's a long shot but have tried searching all these permutations of the key words I can come up with and no luck so far. Hope someone can help.\n\nCheers!",

In this case, I can't just look in my 'saved' catelouge because it's been so long since I saved the video that I'd just be scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.\n\nAnyway, the artist has a popular reel to a Patrick Bateman, American Psycho, audio- the one where he says his mask of sanity is about to slip. They have an ongoing story with their OC(s) about a girl with white hair and her boyfriend.\n\nIn said story the boyfriend has a chip implanted into him and his body/conciousness keeps being taken over by the robotic chip changing his personality and it takes years for anyone to notice. The robot in the chip, who keeps taking over the boyfriend's body, eventually falls for the girlfriend-but she, upon finding out that it's not really her boyfriend, is disgusted by him and wants her real boyfriend back.\n\nI remember their both of their dads' had something going on with the goverment too. There's this one post where they tell their respective son and daughter: 'I hope you never live a life as eventful as mine'\n\nLastly, I know that there was another name given to the robot in the boyfriend upon finding out it wasn't really him--something like 'Gnat' or 'Nert'? I don't know. I think the artist was planning on realeasing a webcomic about them soorner or later...\n\nSooooo, thats's basically the highlights of what I remember-- if anyone figures it out or has a guess (no matter how unsure) please comment! This has been itching my brain for awhile now.\n\nThanks :)",

However that is not the case. I was given multiple chances to go back and get it, but I didn’t have a reliable way to get there. \n\nWith that being said, my blanket is gone. I have played with the idea of getting another one but I have searched google, I have looked all over the internet and I keep getting discouraged. \n\nI am unsure of the brand. There were no tags on it. The blanket was small, quilted. With blue squares with stripes, white squares with pink flowers, and underneath the blanket, there were kittens playing with balls of yarn. What made it so special was the holes in it from all of the years I’ve had it. And at the bottom of the blanket, there was random colorful threads which were my first stitched I ever done with my great grandmother. (Dearly departed.) The last sliver of information I have on this blanket is it was purchased in the year 1987. I am really unsure.

I bought a wool turtleneck for cyber monday and just got it today and absolutely love it but my mom thought it would be \"funny\" to stretch the neck out over my head. Its not SUPER noticeable and you cant tell just looking at it but I can still feel it enough when I put it on and that killed my joy. I didnt wash it but I cut the tag off and still have the tags themselves but the little plastic thingy is cut. I even tried using a lighter to melt the plastic ends together but you can kinda see that\n\nWould they reject my (online) return and I have to just eat the loss? I dont want to be shitty and abuse the system but I was really looking forward to having it as a christmas present to myself after an already shitty year and I cant afford to rebuy if its a loss. She's mad at me for being upset about it so its a long walk for me to go drop it off myself even if I tried to so I wanna know if its even worth an attempt",

    "text": "Really dumb question but anyone ever returned something to banana republic with the tags but cut off the plastic thingy? Sorry lol but I'm on disability so the 40 bucks is a really significant sum of money to me. I bought a wool turtleneck for cyber monday and just got it today and absolutely love it but my mom thought it would be \"funny\" to stretch the neck out over my head. Its not SUPER noticeable and you cant tell just looking at it but I can still feel it enough when I put it on and that killed my joy. I didnt wash it but I cut the tag off and still have the tags themselves but the little plastic thingy is cut. I even tried using a lighter to melt the plastic ends together but you can kinda see that\n\nWould they reject my (online) return and I have to just eat the loss? I dont want to be shitty and abuse the system but I was really looking forward to having it as a christmas present to myself after an already shitty year and I cant afford to rebuy if its a loss. She's mad at me for being upset about it so its a long walk for me to go drop it off myself even if I tried to so I wanna know if its even worth an attempt",

    "text": "Threads of Apollo ripped me off This all goes back to 2020, when I ordered a jacket in a 3xl size. I waited 9 weeks for it to arrive, which was a lot longer than estimated delivery that was advertised on their website. When it finally arrived it was NOWHERE NEAR a 3xl size. It was basically a MEDIUM. I had my mom try it on, who's not a large woman, and it was snug on her. \n\nI reached out to them, and was told that the jacket was FINAL SALE, and cannot be returned. I was livid, and just assumed that I got scammed. They didn't have much of a reputation yet, so I knew that I was taking a risk by buying from them in the first place. They ended up closing their doors, soon after that.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago, and I see on the FMF sub, that Threads of Apollo are back in business. So, I commented on that post, asking that they rectify their sizing issues, which they admit to having in the past. \n\nThey told me that they'll take care of it, and I just needed to email my info. So, I did exactly that. I sent an email 2 weeks ago, no response. So I emailed them again a week ago, still no response, completely ghosted. I feel like I've been very patient with them, and cordial. I let them know that I have the original jacket, and It's unworn, if we could work out an exchange of some sort. \n\nJust thought I'd give a heads up to anyone considering this company. Buyer beware!",

    "text": "Really dumb question but anyone ever returned something to banana republic with the tags but cut off the plastic thingy? Sorry lol but I'm on disability so the 40 bucks is a really significant sum of money to me. I bought a wool turtleneck for cyber monday and just got it today and absolutely love it but my mom thought it would be \"funny\" to stretch the neck out over my head. Its not SUPER noticeable and you cant tell just looking at it but I can still feel it enough when I put it on and that killed my joy. I didnt wash it but I cut the tag off and still have the tags themselves but the little plastic thingy is cut. I even tried using a lighter to melt the plastic ends together but you can kinda see that\n\nWould they reject my (online) return and I have to just eat the loss? I dont want to be shitty and abuse the system but I was really looking forward to having it as a christmas present to myself after an already shitty year and I cant afford to rebuy if its a loss. She's mad at me for being upset about it so its a long walk for me to go drop it off myself even if I tried to so I wanna know if its even worth an attempt",

    "text": "Threads of Apollo ripped me off This all goes back to 2020, when I ordered a jacket in a 3xl size. I waited 9 weeks for it to arrive, which was a lot longer than estimated delivery that was advertised on their website. When it finally arrived it was NOWHERE NEAR a 3xl size. It was basically a MEDIUM. I had my mom try it on, who's not a large woman, and it was snug on her. \n\nI reached out to them, and was told that the jacket was FINAL SALE, and cannot be returned. I was livid, and just assumed that I got scammed. They didn't have much of a reputation yet, so I knew that I was taking a risk by buying from them in the first place. They ended up closing their doors, soon after that.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago, and I see on the FMF sub, that Threads of Apollo are back in business. So, I commented on that post, asking that they rectify their sizing issues, which they admit to having in the past. \n\nThey told me that they'll take care of it, and I just needed to email my info. So, I did exactly that. I sent an email 2 weeks ago, no response. So I emailed them again a week ago, still no response, completely ghosted. I feel like I've been very patient with them, and cordial. I let them know that I have the original jacket, and It's unworn, if we could work out an exchange of some sort. \n\nJust thought I'd give a heads up to anyone considering this company. Buyer beware!",

I've also been thinking I should start looking a little more age-appropriate (early 30s) and get a decent pair of boots. Was wondering if you guys would have any recs for something versatile (easy hikes / winter weather, nice family dinner, casual networking events) that won't make my chucks wearing ass feel too weird and old? Maybe a Chelsea boot?",

Here is where I am at: mid-forties, slim/average build, good physical shape and around 5’9”. I’ve always struggled with locking down my style, I pretty much carry the wardrobe of the Spice Girls…Sporty, Dress (Posh), and the ones that didn’t make the cut: Outdoorsy, and Country. I’ve been upgrading pieces across labels like Faherty, Billy Reid…while eyeing Sid Mashburn and on the other spectrum Luca Faloni and others. Then I revert to my default of liking items from Kuhl, Patagonia (outdoorsy), Barbour and Belstaff. I feel like I’m making a mess out of the situation. While I am willing to invest money in clothes, doing so without a plan or really locking down a style seems fruitless. I get it is personal, but has anyone else struggled with this and found a good solution?",

    "text": "Last Christmas I traveled to Scandinavia solo So last Christmas I decided to do the whole “find myself” thing and went to Scandinavia alone. Very on the road. Very introspective. Very lonely.\n\nAt one point I’m on this old-fashioned train, the kind with compartments like in Harry Potter.\n\nI sit down across from two guys. One is wearing a classic navy pea coat, very put-together, looks like he could explain interest rates calmly. The other is in a vintage Soviet Union hockey jersey, staring out the window like the train personally betrayed him.\n\nThe pea coat guy smiles.\n“I’m Sven,” he says warmly. “And this is my friend, Ulf.”\n\nUlf does not acknowledge this introduction in any way. No nod. No grunt. Just resentment, radiating.\n\nAfter a while I notice they’re drinking beers, so I ask, “Oh hey, where did you get those?”\n\nUlf finally turns toward me like I’ve just asked if snow is cold.\n\n“Did you not see the bar car?” he says.\n\nI apologize. I say I must have missed it. I ask what kind of beers they have.\n\nSven opens his mouth to answer, but Ulf beats him to it, sighing heavily, like he’s been cursed to explain this forever.\n\n“They have an IPA,” he says, “which is fine if you like pine trees arguing with you. A lager that’s aggressively adequate. A pilsner that tastes like disappointment. And a stout that feels like a bad idea until you’re already committed. But you should really try the sours.”\n\nThen he stands up, looks me dead in the eye, and adds, “Or, you could read the menu yourself and stop bothering strangers.”\n\nAnd with that, he storms out of the compartment.\n\nThere’s a long, awkward silence. The train rattles on. Snow drifts past the window. Somewhere, a child probably drops a mitten.\n\nI finally turn to Sven and ask, “So…what’s his problem?”\n\nSven rubs his temples and sighs the sigh of a man who has explained this many times before.\n\n“Well,” he says, “it’s Christmas, he’s grumpy, and honestly…”\n\nHe pauses.\n\n“…Rude Ulf the Red knows train beer.”",

One of the men tentatively tastes his martini.  It's perfect!  The men finish their martinis, and order another round.  Again, the bartender serves them another 4 excellent martinis.\n\n“That’s 80 cents, please.”\n\nThey pay the 80 cents, and they're thinking, how does this guy do it?  After all, each of them has had 2 martinis and hasn't even spent a dollar yet.  \n  \nFinally one of them says to the bartender, “Excuse my curiosity, but how in the world can you afford to serve these superb martinis for 20 cents each?”\n\n“I’m a retired teacher from Phoenix, says the bartender, “and it’s always been my dream to own a bar.  Last year I hit the Powerball Jackpot for $250 million and decided to open this place.  Every drink costs 20 cents.  Beer, wine, whiskey, gin….all the same.”\n\nOne of the men says, “Wow! That’s a helluva story.”\n\nThe four men are sipping their martinis, but they can’t help noticing 7 other people down at the end of the bar who don’t have any drinks in front of them, and haven’t ordered anything the whole time they’ve been there.\n\nNodding his head towards the 7 at the end of the bar, one of the men asks the bartender, “What’s up with them?”\n\n\"Oh them? They’re retired people from Florida. (looks at his watch) They’re waiting  \nfor Happy Hour when drinks are half-price.\"",

    "text": "Four old retirees are walking down a street in Tombstone, Arizona... ...when they see a sign that reads, “Old Timers Club: ALL DRINKS 20 cents.”\n\nThe men look at each other in disbelief, thinking that there's gotta be a catch somewhere, but it's only a buck for the four of them, so they decide, what the hell and go inside.\n\nThe elderly bartender greets them:\n\n“Welcome, gentlemen to the Old Timers Club.  What’ll it be?”\n\nThe men check out the fully stocked bar and order 4 martinis, and just 2 minutes later, the bartender serves up four perfect martinis.   \n\n“That’s 20 cents each, please.”\n\nThe four men stare at the bartender for a moment, then at each other.  They pay the 80 cents.  One of the men tentatively tastes his martini.  It's perfect!  The men finish their martinis, and order another round.  Again, the bartender serves them another 4 excellent martinis.\n\n“That’s 80 cents, please.”\n\nThey pay the 80 cents, and they're thinking, how does this guy do it?  After all, each of them has had 2 martinis and hasn't even spent a dollar yet.  \n  \nFinally one of them says to the bartender, “Excuse my curiosity, but how in the world can you afford to serve these superb martinis for 20 cents each?”\n\n“I’m a retired teacher from Phoenix, says the bartender, “and it’s always been my dream to own a bar.  Last year I hit the Powerball Jackpot for $250 million and decided to open this place.  Every drink costs 20 cents.  Beer, wine, whiskey, gin….all the same.”\n\nOne of the men says, “Wow! That’s a helluva story.”\n\nThe four men are sipping their martinis, but they can’t help noticing 7 other people down at the end of the bar who don’t have any drinks in front of them, and haven’t ordered anything the whole time they’ve been there.\n\nNodding his head towards the 7 at the end of the bar, one of the men asks the bartender, “What’s up with them?”\n\n\"Oh them? They’re retired people from Florida. (looks at his watch) They’re waiting  \nfor Happy Hour when drinks are half-price.\"",

    "text": "Last Christmas I traveled to Scandinavia solo So last Christmas I decided to do the whole “find myself” thing and went to Scandinavia alone. Very on the road. Very introspective. Very lonely.\n\nAt one point I’m on this old-fashioned train, the kind with compartments like in Harry Potter.\n\nI sit down across from two guys. One is wearing a classic navy pea coat, very put-together, looks like he could explain interest rates calmly. The other is in a vintage Soviet Union hockey jersey, staring out the window like the train personally betrayed him.\n\nThe pea coat guy smiles.\n“I’m Sven,” he says warmly. “And this is my friend, Ulf.”\n\nUlf does not acknowledge this introduction in any way. No nod. No grunt. Just resentment, radiating.\n\nAfter a while I notice they’re drinking beers, so I ask, “Oh hey, where did you get those?”\n\nUlf finally turns toward me like I’ve just asked if snow is cold.\n\n“Did you not see the bar car?” he says.\n\nI apologize. I say I must have missed it. I ask what kind of beers they have.\n\nSven opens his mouth to answer, but Ulf beats him to it, sighing heavily, like he’s been cursed to explain this forever.\n\n“They have an IPA,” he says, “which is fine if you like pine trees arguing with you. A lager that’s aggressively adequate. A pilsner that tastes like disappointment. And a stout that feels like a bad idea until you’re already committed. But you should really try the sours.”\n\nThen he stands up, looks me dead in the eye, and adds, “Or, you could read the menu yourself and stop bothering strangers.”\n\nAnd with that, he storms out of the compartment.\n\nThere’s a long, awkward silence. The train rattles on. Snow drifts past the window. Somewhere, a child probably drops a mitten.\n\nI finally turn to Sven and ask, “So…what’s his problem?”\n\nSven rubs his temples and sighs the sigh of a man who has explained this many times before.\n\n“Well,” he says, “it’s Christmas, he’s grumpy, and honestly…”\n\nHe pauses.\n\n“…Rude Ulf the Red knows train beer.”",

There are THOUSANDS of people cheering. There are streamers and a huge banner that says \"WELCOME, FRANK!\" There's a band of angels playing upbeat music. Jesus and Saint Peter are waiting, and run up to shake his hand.\n\nA little shell-shocked from his recent death and the hubbub, Frank looks at Peter and says, \"Why am I getting such an amazing reception? Is it always like this?!\"\n\nPeter exclaims, \"No, not at all! You're just the oldest person we've ever welcomed in to Heaven!\"\n\nFrank blinks and says, \"Nobody over 53 has ever entered heaven?\"\n\nSt. Peter and Jesus look at each other for a moment, confused. Peter looks back at  Peter pulls out a scroll and starts skimming it. \"Wait a moment,\" he says. \"Fifty-three? Our records say you're two hundred and six!\"\n\nFrank is puzzled and asks, \"How do you figure that?\"\n\n\"Well,\" St. Peter replies, \"We couldn't find your date of birth in the records, so we just totalled all your billable hours.\"",

One of the men tentatively tastes his martini.  It's perfect!  The men finish their martinis, and order another round.  Again, the bartender serves them another 4 excellent martinis.\n\n“That’s 80 cents, please.”\n\nThey pay the 80 cents, and they're thinking, how does this guy do it?  After all, each of them has had 2 martinis and hasn't even spent a dollar yet.  \n  \nFinally one of them says to the bartender, “Excuse my curiosity, but how in the world can you afford to serve these superb martinis for 20 cents each?”\n\n“I’m a retired teacher from Phoenix, says the bartender, “and it’s always been my dream to own a bar.  Last year I hit the Powerball Jackpot for $250 million and decided to open this place.  Every drink costs 20 cents.  Beer, wine, whiskey, gin….all the same.”\n\nOne of the men says, “Wow! That’s a helluva story.”\n\nThe four men are sipping their martinis, but they can’t help noticing 7 other people down at the end of the bar who don’t have any drinks in front of them, and haven’t ordered anything the whole time they’ve been there.\n\nNodding his head towards the 7 at the end of the bar, one of the men asks the bartender, “What’s up with them?”\n\n\"Oh them? They’re retired people from Florida. (looks at his watch) They’re waiting  \nfor Happy Hour when drinks are half-price.\"",

    "text": "Last Christmas I traveled to Scandinavia solo So last Christmas I decided to do the whole “find myself” thing and went to Scandinavia alone. Very on the road. Very introspective. Very lonely.\n\nAt one point I’m on this old-fashioned train, the kind with compartments like in Harry Potter.\n\nI sit down across from two guys. One is wearing a classic navy pea coat, very put-together, looks like he could explain interest rates calmly. The other is in a vintage Soviet Union hockey jersey, staring out the window like the train personally betrayed him.\n\nThe pea coat guy smiles.\n“I’m Sven,” he says warmly. “And this is my friend, Ulf.”\n\nUlf does not acknowledge this introduction in any way. No nod. No grunt. Just resentment, radiating.\n\nAfter a while I notice they’re drinking beers, so I ask, “Oh hey, where did you get those?”\n\nUlf finally turns toward me like I’ve just asked if snow is cold.\n\n“Did you not see the bar car?” he says.\n\nI apologize. I say I must have missed it. I ask what kind of beers they have.\n\nSven opens his mouth to answer, but Ulf beats him to it, sighing heavily, like he’s been cursed to explain this forever.\n\n“They have an IPA,” he says, “which is fine if you like pine trees arguing with you. A lager that’s aggressively adequate. A pilsner that tastes like disappointment. And a stout that feels like a bad idea until you’re already committed. But you should really try the sours.”\n\nThen he stands up, looks me dead in the eye, and adds, “Or, you could read the menu yourself and stop bothering strangers.”\n\nAnd with that, he storms out of the compartment.\n\nThere’s a long, awkward silence. The train rattles on. Snow drifts past the window. Somewhere, a child probably drops a mitten.\n\nI finally turn to Sven and ask, “So…what’s his problem?”\n\nSven rubs his temples and sighs the sigh of a man who has explained this many times before.\n\n“Well,” he says, “it’s Christmas, he’s grumpy, and honestly…”\n\nHe pauses.\n\n“…Rude Ulf the Red knows train beer.”",

    "text": "Last Christmas I traveled to Scandinavia solo So last Christmas I decided to do the whole “find myself” thing and went to Scandinavia alone. Very on the road. Very introspective. Very lonely.\n\nAt one point I’m on this old-fashioned train, the kind with compartments like in Harry Potter.\n\nI sit down across from two guys. One is wearing a classic navy pea coat, very put-together, looks like he could explain interest rates calmly. The other is in a vintage Soviet Union hockey jersey, staring out the window like the train personally betrayed him.\n\nThe pea coat guy smiles.\n“I’m Sven,” he says warmly. “And this is my friend, Ulf.”\n\nUlf does not acknowledge this introduction in any way. No nod. No grunt. Just resentment, radiating.\n\nAfter a while I notice they’re drinking beers, so I ask, “Oh hey, where did you get those?”\n\nUlf finally turns toward me like I’ve just asked if snow is cold.\n\n“Did you not see the bar car?” he says.\n\nI apologize. I say I must have missed it. I ask what kind of beers they have.\n\nSven opens his mouth to answer, but Ulf beats him to it, sighing heavily, like he’s been cursed to explain this forever.\n\n“They have an IPA,” he says, “which is fine if you like pine trees arguing with you. A lager that’s aggressively adequate. A pilsner that tastes like disappointment. And a stout that feels like a bad idea until you’re already committed. But you should really try the sours.”\n\nThen he stands up, looks me dead in the eye, and adds, “Or, you could read the menu yourself and stop bothering strangers.”\n\nAnd with that, he storms out of the compartment.\n\nThere’s a long, awkward silence. The train rattles on. Snow drifts past the window. Somewhere, a child probably drops a mitten.\n\nI finally turn to Sven and ask, “So…what’s his problem?”\n\nSven rubs his temples and sighs the sigh of a man who has explained this many times before.\n\n“Well,” he says, “it’s Christmas, he’s grumpy, and honestly…”\n\nHe pauses.\n\n“…Rude Ulf the Red knows train beer.”",

One of the men tentatively tastes his martini.  It's perfect!  The men finish their martinis, and order another round.  Again, the bartender serves them another 4 excellent martinis.\n\n“That’s 80 cents, please.”\n\nThey pay the 80 cents, and they're thinking, how does this guy do it?  After all, each of them has had 2 martinis and hasn't even spent a dollar yet.  \n  \nFinally one of them says to the bartender, “Excuse my curiosity, but how in the world can you afford to serve these superb martinis for 20 cents each?”\n\n“I’m a retired teacher from Phoenix, says the bartender, “and it’s always been my dream to own a bar.  Last year I hit the Powerball Jackpot for $250 million and decided to open this place.  Every drink costs 20 cents.  Beer, wine, whiskey, gin….all the same.”\n\nOne of the men says, “Wow! That’s a helluva story.”\n\nThe four men are sipping their martinis, but they can’t help noticing 7 other people down at the end of the bar who don’t have any drinks in front of them, and haven’t ordered anything the whole time they’ve been there.\n\nNodding his head towards the 7 at the end of the bar, one of the men asks the bartender, “What’s up with them?”\n\n\"Oh them? They’re retired people from Florida. (looks at his watch) They’re waiting  \nfor Happy Hour when drinks are half-price.\"",

We got your test results back. It’s stage 4 bone cancer”\n\nAnd the guy says “wh… what? Can you treat it”\n\n“Not at this stage. It’s metastasised everywher. You’re looking at weeks, not months”.\n\n“Well what can I do?”\n\n“There’s nothing you can do. I suggest you get your affairs in order and we’ll arrange for palliative care and try to make you as comfortable as possible”\n\n“But, but, I’m only 32 years old” says the man, breaking down into tears. “I’ve got a kid, he’s only five years old. What do I tell him? What do I tell my wife!?”\n\nAnd the doctor says “ahhhhh, only joking knobhead, you’ve broken your finger!”",
